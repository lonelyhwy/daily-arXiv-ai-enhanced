TL;DR: The paper proposes robustness losses to reduce technical variability bias in downstream models using foundation models for histopathology, improving accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases from pre-analytic and scanner-specific variations in foundation models for computational pathology.

Method: Introducing novel robustness losses during downstream model training, tested on 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients using eight foundation models.

Result: Improved robustness and prediction accuracy by focusing on biologically relevant features.

Conclusion: Mitigates robustness issues without retraining foundation models, enhancing real-world clinical applicability.

Abstract: Foundation models in histopathology are expected to facilitate the development of high-performing and generalisable deep learning systems. However, current models capture not only biologically relevant features, but also pre-analytic and scanner-specific variation that bias the predictions of task-specific models trained from the foundation model features. Here we show that introducing novel robustness losses during training of downstream task-specific models reduces sensitivity to technical variability. A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice.

*Liping Meng,Fan Nie,Yunyun Zhang,Chao Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MNAS-Unet combines MCTS and NAS for medical image segmentation, improving efficiency and accuracy while reducing search budget and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural architecture search for medical image segmentation under practical resource constraints.

Method: Proposes MNAS-Unet, integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to dynamically explore architectures and optimize DownSC/UpSC units.

Result: Outperforms NAS-Unet and others in segmentation accuracy on PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS datasets; reduces search budget by 54% and achieves a lightweight model with 0.6M parameters.

Conclusion: MNAS-Unet improves search efficiency and maintains competitive segmentation accuracy, making it practical for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel medical image segmentation framework, MNAS-Unet, which combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). MNAS-Unet dynamically explores promising network architectures through MCTS, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of architecture search. It also optimizes the DownSC and UpSC unit structures, enabling fast and precise model adjustments. Experimental results demonstrate that MNAS-Unet outperforms NAS-Unet and other state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on several medical image datasets, including PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS. Furthermore, compared with NAS-Unet, MNAS-Unet reduces the architecture search budget by 54% (early stopping at 139 epochs versus 300 epochs under the same search setting), while achieving a lightweight model with only 0.6M parameters and lower GPU memory consumption, which further improves its practical applicability. These results suggest that MNAS-Unet can improve search efficiency while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy under practical resource constraints.

### [3] [AeroDGS: Physically Consistent Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Single-Sequence Aerial 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22376)
*Hanyang Liu,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AeroDGS is a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos, addressing challenges like depth ambiguity and unstable motion in aerial scene reconstruction by leveraging geometry lifting and physics-guided optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D scene reconstruction methods struggle with aerial conditions involving single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects with large motion disparity, leading to depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation.

Method: AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module for reconstructing static and dynamic geometry, and a Physics-Guided Optimization module incorporating priors like ground-support and trajectory-smoothness to resolve monocular ambiguity.

Result: The framework achieves superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real UAV scenes.

Conclusion: AeroDGS effectively addresses the challenges of monocular aerial reconstruction by integrating geometry lifting and physics-guided optimization, demonstrating robust performance in dynamic aerial environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D scene reconstruction have significantly improved dynamic modeling across various domains. However, existing approaches remain limited under aerial conditions with single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects of limited spatial footprint and large motion disparity. These challenges cause severe depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation, making monocular aerial reconstruction inherently ill-posed. To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution. We additionally build a real-world UAV dataset that spans various altitudes and motion conditions to evaluate dynamic aerial reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real UAV scenes demonstrate that AeroDGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments.

### [4] [Enhancing Renal Tumor Malignancy Prediction: Deep Learning with Automatic 3D CT Organ Focused Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22381)
*Zhengkang Fan,Chengkun Sun,Russell Terry,Jie Xu,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using an Organ Focused Attention loss function eliminates the need for manual segmentation in predicting renal tumor malignancy, achieving high accuracy on both private and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imaging modalities lack accuracy for predicting renal tumor malignancy, and manual segmentation is resource-intensive.

Method: Developed a deep learning framework with OFA loss to modify patch attention, avoiding manual segmentation.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 0.685 (private) and 0.760 (public), with F1-scores of 0.872 and 0.852, outperforming segmentation-based models.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, reliable malignancy prediction method, improving clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of malignancy in renal tumors is crucial for informing clinical decisions and optimizing treatment strategies. However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input. The findings suggest that this approach offers a more efficient and reliable method for malignancy prediction, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.

### [5] [Vision Transformers Need More Than Registers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22394)
*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies lazy aggregation behavior in Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the cause of artifacts, proposes a solution to mitigate background-dominated shortcuts, and shows improved performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the artifacts observed in ViTs across various supervision paradigms and tasks, which stem from lazy aggregation behavior.

Method: Systematically analyzes ViT artifacts, identifies lazy aggregation (using irrelevant background patches as shortcuts), and proposes selectively integrating patch features into the CLS token.

Result: The solution consistently improves performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into ViT behavior and offers a practical method to enhance performance by reducing background-dominated shortcuts.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), when pre-trained on large-scale data, provide general-purpose representations for diverse downstream tasks. However, artifacts in ViTs are widely observed across different supervision paradigms and downstream tasks. Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision. We hope this work offers a new perspective on ViT behavior.

### [6] [CLIP Is Shortsighted: Paying Attention Beyond the First Sentence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22419)
*Marc-Antoine Lavoie,Anas Mahmoud,Aldo Zaimi,Arsene Fansi Tchango,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeBias-CLIP improves CLIP's alignment with dense descriptions by addressing biases in long captions, achieving better retrieval performance without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's pretraining focuses on short captions, limiting its ability to handle complex scenes and dense descriptions. Fine-tuning with long captions introduces a bias where attention is concentrated on opening summaries, weakening alignment with the rest of the text.

Method: DeBias-CLIP removes summary sentences during training, uses sentence sub-sampling, and applies text token padding to evenly distribute supervision across all tokens.

Result: DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and shows robustness to sentence order changes.

Conclusion: DeBias-CLIP effectively addresses biases in long-caption training, enhancing CLIP's performance without requiring additional parameters.

Abstract: CLIP models learn transferable multi-modal features via image-text contrastive learning on internet-scale data. They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations. It is a drop-in replacement for Long-CLIP with no additional trainable parameters.

### [7] [SimpleOCR: Rendering Visualized Questions to Teach MLLMs to Read](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22426)
*Yibo Peng,Peng Xia,Ding Zhong,Kaide Zeng,Siwei Han,Yiyang Zhou,Jiaqi Liu,Ruiyi Zhang,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper diagnoses MLLMs' reliance on text prompts over visual text extraction, introduces the VQ setting to enforce visual engagement, and proposes SimpleOCR, a training strategy that improves performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if MLLMs genuinely read text in images or rely on parametric shortcuts, and to address the discovered 'modality laziness.'

Method: Introduces Visualized-Question (VQ) setting and SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy with randomized styles to enforce visual text extraction.

Result: SimpleOCR improves performance by 5.4% over the base model and 2.7% over GRPO, achieving superior results with 30x fewer samples (8.5K).

Conclusion: SimpleOCR effectively bridges the capability-utilization gap in MLLMs, demonstrating robust gains and efficient integration with advanced strategies.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a critical question regarding their visual grounding mechanism remains unanswered: do these models genuinely ``read'' text embedded in images, or do they merely rely on parametric shortcuts in the text prompt? In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements.

### [8] [Exploring Multimodal LMMs for Online Episodic Memory Question Answering on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22455)
*Giuseppe Lando,Rosario Forte,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for real-time episodic memory QA on edge devices, addressing privacy and latency concerns compared to cloud solutions. A two-thread pipeline achieves competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and latency issues with cloud offloading for wearable assistants drive the need for edge-based solutions.

Method: A two-thread pipeline: Descriptor Thread converts video to text memory; QA Thread answers queries. Tested on QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark under resource limits.

Result: Edge implementation achieves 51.76%-54.40% accuracy (TTFT 0.41s-0.88s), close to cloud's 56%.

Conclusion: Edge-based MLLMs offer viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for episodic memory QA.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for real-time online episodic memory question answering. While cloud offloading is common, it raises privacy and latency concerns for wearable assistants, hence we investigate implementation on the edge. We integrated streaming constraints into our question answering pipeline, which is structured into two asynchronous threads: a Descriptor Thread that continuously converts video into a lightweight textual memory, and a Question Answering (QA) Thread that reasons over the textual memory to answer queries. Experiments on the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark analyze the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within strict resource boundaries, showing promising results also when compared to clound-based solutions. Specifically, an end-to-end configuration running on a consumer-grade 8GB GPU achieves 51.76% accuracy with a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 0.41s. Scaling to a local enterprise-grade server yields 54.40% accuracy with a TTFT of 0.88s. In comparison, a cloud-based solution obtains an accuracy of 56.00%. These competitive results highlight the potential of edge-based solutions for privacy-preserving episodic memory retrieval.

### [9] [MammoWise: Multi-Model Local RAG Pipeline for Mammography Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22462)
*Raiyan Jahangir,Nafiz Imtiaz Khan,Amritanand Sudheerkumar,Vladimir Filkov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoWise is a local multi-model pipeline using open-source VLMs for mammogram report generation and multi-task classification, improving report quality with few-shot prompting and RAG, and achieving reliable classification with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of closed cloud systems in mammography reporting by offering a privacy-focused, adaptable, and reproducible solution.

Method: Utilizes Ollama-hosted VLMs (MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, Qwen2.5-VL) with zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, plus multimodal RAG. Evaluated on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets.

Result: Report generation improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. MedGemma fine-tuning achieves BI-RADS accuracy 0.7545, density accuracy 0.8840, and calcification accuracy 0.9341.

Conclusion: MammoWise offers a practical, extensible framework for local mammography reporting with consistent performance and reliability.

Abstract: Screening mammography is high volume, time sensitive, and documentation heavy. Radiologists must translate subtle visual findings into consistent BI-RADS assessments, breast density categories, and structured narrative reports. While recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) enable image-to-text reporting, many rely on closed cloud systems or tightly coupled architectures that limit privacy, reproducibility, and adaptability. We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality. MammoWise provides a practical and extensible framework for deploying local VLMs for mammography reporting within a unified and reproducible workflow.

### [10] [Beyond Dominant Patches: Spatial Credit Redistribution For Grounded Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22469)
*Niamul Hassan Samin,Md Arifur Rahman,Abdullah Ibne Hanif,Juena Ahmed Noshin,Md Ashikur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCR is a training-free method reducing object hallucination in VLMs by redistributing activation credit spatially, achieving significant improvements with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial credit collapse in VLMs, where activation concentrates on sparse patches, leading to object hallucination by suppressing context.

Method: Introduces Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), redistributing hidden-state activation from high-attention patches to context during inference.

Result: Reduces hallucination by 4.7-6.0 pp on POPE-Adversarial and improves CHAIR scores significantly while preserving CIDEr. Minimal overhead (~43-56 ms).

Conclusion: SCR effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs with low computational cost, Pareto-dominating existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently hallucinate objects absent from the input image. We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver.

### [11] [Pix2Key: Controllable Open-Vocabulary Retrieval with Semantic Decomposition and Self-Supervised Visual Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22510)
*Guoyizhe Wei,Yang Jiao,Nan Xi,Zhishen Huang,Jingjing Meng,Rama Chellappa,Yan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pix2Key improves Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) by using open-vocabulary visual dictionaries for intent-aware matching and diversity-aware reranking, outperforming existing methods on the DFMM-Compose benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods either lose fine-grained cues with supervised triplets or miss implicit user intent and diversity with caption-based zero-shot approaches. Pix2Key aims to address these limitations.

Method: Pix2Key represents queries and candidates as open-vocabulary visual dictionaries, enabling unified intent-aware constraint matching and diversity-aware reranking. It includes a self-supervised pretraining component, V-Dict-AE, to enhance dictionary representation.

Result: Pix2Key achieves up to a 3.2-point improvement in Recall@10 on the DFMM-Compose benchmark, with an additional 2.3-point gain from V-Dict-AE, while improving intent consistency and maintaining diversity.

Conclusion: Pix2Key demonstrates superior performance in CIR by leveraging visual dictionaries and self-supervised pretraining, offering a more effective and flexible solution compared to traditional and zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) uses a reference image plus a natural-language edit to retrieve images that apply the requested change while preserving other relevant visual content. Classic fusion pipelines typically rely on supervised triplets and can lose fine-grained cues, while recent zero-shot approaches often caption the reference image and merge the caption with the edit, which may miss implicit user intent and return repetitive results. We present Pix2Key, which represents both queries and candidates as open-vocabulary visual dictionaries, enabling intent-aware constraint matching and diversity-aware reranking in a unified embedding space. A self-supervised pretraining component, V-Dict-AE, further improves the dictionary representation using only images, strengthening fine-grained attribute understanding without CIR-specific supervision. On the DFMM-Compose benchmark, Pix2Key improves Recall@10 up to 3.2 points, and adding V-Dict-AE yields an additional 2.3-point gain while improving intent consistency and maintaining high list diversity.

### [12] [DisQ-HNet: A Disentangled Quantized Half-UNet for Interpretable Multimodal Image Synthesis Applications to Tau-PET Synthesis from T1 and FLAIR MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22545)
*Agamdeep S. Chopra,Caitlin Neher,Tianyi Ren,Juampablo E. Heras Rivera,Mehmet Kurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisQ-HNet synthesizes tau-PET images from MRI scans, using a novel framework that combines a PID-guided encoder and a Half-UNet decoder, outperforming existing methods in fidelity and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and limited availability of tau-PET scans motivate the development of MRI-based alternatives for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology.

Method: The method uses a PID-guided, vector-quantized encoder to partition latent information and a Half-UNet decoder with pseudo-skip connections for preserving anatomical detail.

Result: DisQ-HNet outperforms baselines (VAE, VQ-VAE, UNet) in reconstruction fidelity and preserves disease-relevant signals for tasks like Braak staging and tau localization.

Conclusion: DisQ-HNet provides a cost-effective, MRI-based alternative to tau-PET, with interpretable modality-specific attributions.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) provides an in vivo marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology, but cost and limited availability motivate MRI-based alternatives. We introduce DisQ-HNet (DQH), a framework that synthesizes tau-PET from paired T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI while exposing how each modality contributes to the prediction. The method combines (i) a Partial Information Decomposition (PID)-guided, vector-quantized encoder that partitions latent information into redundant, unique, and complementary components, and (ii) a Half-UNet decoder that preserves anatomical detail using pseudo-skip connections conditioned on structural edge cues rather than direct encoder feature reuse. Across multiple baselines (VAE, VQ-VAE, and UNet), DisQ-HNet maintains reconstruction fidelity and better preserves disease-relevant signal for downstream AD tasks, including Braak staging, tau localization, and classification. PID-based Shapley analysis provides modality-specific attribution of synthesized uptake patterns.

### [13] [DrivePTS: A Progressive Learning Framework with Textual and Structural Enhancement for Driving Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22549)
*Zhechao Wang,Yiming Zeng,Lufan Ma,Zeqing Fu,Chen Bai,Ziyao Lin,Cheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivePTS improves diverse driving scene generation by addressing inter-condition dependency, semantic context limitations, and structural detail loss with progressive learning, hierarchical descriptions, and frequency-guided loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail due to implicit inter-condition dependency and insufficient semantic/structural details, limiting robustness and generalization in autonomous driving systems.

Method: DrivePTS uses progressive learning with mutual information constraints, multi-view hierarchical descriptions from a Vision-Language Model, and a frequency-guided structure loss.

Result: DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability, successfully generating rare scenes where prior methods fail.

Conclusion: DrivePTS enhances generalization and robustness in driving scene synthesis, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Synthesis of diverse driving scenes serves as a crucial data augmentation technique for validating the robustness and generalizability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes. Notably, DrivePTS successfully generates rare scenes where prior methods fail, highlighting its strong generalization ability.

*Kang Han,Wei Xiang,Lu Yu,Mathew Wyatt,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiftNDC is a fast framework using Neural Depth Correction for consistent depth maps, enabling efficient 3D reconstruction and improved novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth-guided 3D reconstruction methods suffer from scale drift, inconsistencies, and require heavy refinement. SwiftNDC aims to address these issues efficiently.

Method: SwiftNDC uses a Neural Depth Correction field for cross-view consistent depth maps, generating dense point clouds via back-projection and reprojection-error filtering.

Result: The framework accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting for mesh reconstruction and improves novel-view synthesis quality, reducing optimization time and enhancing fidelity.

Conclusion: SwiftNDC demonstrates the effectiveness of neural depth refinement and robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity, efficient 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Depth-guided 3D reconstruction has gained popularity as a fast alternative to optimization-heavy approaches, yet existing methods still suffer from scale drift, multi-view inconsistencies, and the need for substantial refinement to achieve high-fidelity geometry. Here, we propose SwiftNDC, a fast and general framework built around a Neural Depth Correction field that produces cross-view consistent depth maps. From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis. SwiftNDC consistently reduces running time for accurate mesh reconstruction and boosts rendering fidelity for view synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining neural depth refinement with robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity and efficient 3D reconstruction.

*Peihan Wu,Guanjie Cheng,Yufei Tong,Meng Xi,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QARMVC introduces a quality-aware framework for robust multi-view clustering by leveraging reconstruction discrepancies to quantify noise and using hierarchical learning to mitigate its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noisy robust methods assume binary noise levels, ignoring continuous variations in contamination intensity, which QARMVC addresses.

Method: QARMVC uses an information bottleneck for view reconstruction, quantifies noise via discrepancies, and employs quality-weighted objectives and fusion for noise suppression.

Result: QARMVC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on five datasets, especially with heterogeneous noise.

Conclusion: QARMVC effectively handles real-world heterogeneous noise in multi-view clustering through quality-aware mechanisms.

Abstract: Deep multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable progress but remains vulnerable to complex noise in real-world applications. Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities.

### [16] [Guidance Matters: Rethinking the Evaluation Pitfall for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22570)
*Dian Xie,Shitong Shao,Lichen Bai,Zikai Zhou,Bojun Cheng,Shuo Yang,Jun Wu,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current diffusion guidance methods, revealing biases in evaluation, introducing a fairer framework (GA-Eval), proposing a deceptive method (TDG), and showing that simply scaling CFG outperforms many methods under traditional evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in evaluating diffusion guidance methods and improve fairness in comparing them.

Method: Introduces GA-Eval for fair comparison and designs TDG to test evaluation flaws; compares eight methods under both frameworks.

Result: CFG scaling competes with most methods; GA-Eval reveals biases, and all methods degrade in winning rates vs CFG.

Conclusion: Current evaluation paradigms need rethinking; GA-Eval offers a better framework for assessing diffusion guidance.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has helped diffusion models achieve great conditional generation in various fields. Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field.

### [17] [GIFSplat: Generative Prior-Guided Iterative Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22571)
*Tianyu Chen,Wei Xiang,Kang Han,Yu Lu,Di Wu,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIFSplat is a feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D reconstruction from sparse views, combining efficiency and quality without test-time optimization or gradient backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward methods lack capacity for refinement and struggle with generative priors, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: GIFSplat uses iterative residual updates and distills diffusion priors into Gaussian-level cues for refinement without gradient backpropagation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to +2.1 dB PSNR on benchmarks like DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU.

Conclusion: GIFSplat achieves efficient, high-quality 3D reconstruction without camera poses or test-time optimization.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction offers substantial runtime advantages over per-scene optimization, which remains slow at inference and often fragile under sparse views. However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency. Across DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU, GIFSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines, improving PSNR by up to +2.1 dB, and it maintains second-scale inference time without requiring camera poses or any test-time gradient optimization.

### [18] [Causal Motion Diffusion Models for Autoregressive Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22594)
*Qing Yu,Akihisa Watanabe,Kent Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMDM introduces a causal diffusion transformer for autoregressive motion generation, improving realism, causality, and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion synthesis methods compromise between realism, causality, and real-time applicability.

Method: Uses MAC-VAE for causal latent representations and a diffusion transformer with causal uncertainty for denoising.

Result: Outperforms existing models in semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness with reduced latency.

Conclusion: CMDM offers high-quality, real-time motion synthesis with improved stability and causality.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion diffusion models have substantially improved the realism of human motion synthesis. However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency.

### [19] [Don't let the information slip away](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22595)
*Taozhe Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Association DETR improves object detection by leveraging background context, outperforming YOLOv12 and RT-DETRv2 on COCO val2017.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models neglect background context, which can enhance detection accuracy (e.g., cars on roads).

Method: Proposes Association DETR, focusing on foreground and background features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO val2017.

Conclusion: Incorporating background context significantly improves object detection.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years. The YOLO series of detectors is among the most well-known CNN-based object detection models and cannot be overlooked. The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance. RT-DETR is an outstanding model that outperformed the YOLO series in both speed and accuracy when it was released. Its successor, RT-DETRv2, achieved 53.4 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background. We believe that background information can significantly aid object detection tasks. For example, cars are more likely to appear on roads rather than in offices, while wild animals are more likely to be found in forests or remote areas rather than on busy streets. To address this gap, we propose an object detection model called Association DETR, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other object detection models on the COCO val2017 dataset.

*Yuci Han,Charles Toth,John E. Anderson,William J. Shuart,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BetterScene improves novel view synthesis using sparse photos, leveraging Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and introducing regularization techniques to enhance consistency and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis often produce inconsistent details and artifacts, even with geometry-aware regularizations. BetterScene aims to address these limitations.

Method: BetterScene uses SVD as a backbone and introduces temporal equivariance regularization and vision foundation model-aligned representation in the VAE module. It also integrates a 3D Gaussian Splatting model for feature rendering.

Result: BetterScene outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the DL3DV-10K dataset, producing artifact-free and consistent novel views.

Conclusion: BetterScene successfully enhances novel view synthesis quality by leveraging SVD and novel regularization techniques, achieving superior results.

Abstract: We present BetterScene, an approach to enhance novel view synthesis (NVS) quality for diverse real-world scenes using extremely sparse, unconstrained photos. BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views. We evaluate on the challenging DL3DV-10K dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Ziqi Zhao,Abhijit Mishra,Shounak Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoR-LUT introduces a low-rank unified framework for compact 3D LUT generation, improving image quality with fewer parameters and maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-LUT techniques use dense tensors, which are less efficient. LoR-LUT aims to enhance perceptual quality and reduce complexity by leveraging low-rank residual corrections.

Method: The approach combines residual corrections (low-rank tensors) with basis LUTs, maintaining trilinear interpolation complexity while reducing parameters.

Result: Trained on MIT-Adobe FiveK, LoR-LUT achieves expert-level retouching with high fidelity and sub-megabyte size. An interactive visualization tool aids interpretability.

Conclusion: LoR-LUT provides a compact, efficient, and interpretable solution for LUT-based image enhancement and style transfer.

Abstract: We present LoR-LUT, a unified low-rank formulation for compact and interpretable 3D lookup table (LUT) generation. Unlike conventional 3D-LUT-based techniques that rely on fusion of basis LUTs, which are usually dense tensors, our unified approach extends the current framework by jointly using residual corrections, which are in fact low-rank tensors, together with a set of basis LUTs. The approach described here improves the existing perceptual quality of an image, which is primarily due to the technique's novel use of residual corrections. At the same time, we achieve the same level of trilinear interpolation complexity, using a significantly smaller number of network, residual corrections, and LUT parameters. The experimental results obtained from LoR-LUT, which is trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, reproduce expert-level retouching characteristics with high perceptual fidelity and a sub-megabyte model size. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, termed LoR-LUT Viewer, which transforms an input image into the LUT-adjusted output image, via a number of slidebars that control different parameters. The tool provides an effective way to enhance interpretability and user confidence in the visual results. Overall, our proposed formulation offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient direction for future LUT-based image enhancement and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATtxt is a spectrum-aware vision-language foundation model for Earth observation that uses RGB-only inputs at inference while retaining spectral cues from training, improving zero-shot classification, retrieval, and linear probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language foundation models for satellite imagery face challenges due to multi-spectral input redundancy/misalignment and limited semantic expressiveness in CLIP-style text encoders.

Method: SATtxt employs Spectral Representation Distillation to transfer spectral priors from multi-spectral to RGB models and Spectrally Grounded Alignment with LLMs to enhance visual-text embedding.

Result: SATtxt outperforms baselines by 4.2% in zero-shot classification, 5.9% in retrieval, and 2.7% in linear probing across datasets like EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet.

Conclusion: SATtxt provides an efficient solution for spectrum-aware vision-language learning in Earth observation, enabling scalable RGB-only deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) promise zero-shot and retrieval understanding for Earth observation. While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

TL;DR: Coded-E2LF is a purely event-based method for 4-D light field reconstruction using a coded aperture and stationary event camera, improving hardware flexibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify hardware restrictions and achieve accurate light field reconstruction using only event-based data, unlike previous methods requiring both events and intensity images.

Method: Uses a coded aperture and stationary event-only camera, introduces advancements like clarifying the role of black patterns in aperture coding, and reconstructs the light field theoretically and practically.

Result: Demonstrated successful reconstruction of a 4-D light field with pixel-level accuracy from events alone, validated on real imaging hardware.

Conclusion: Coded-E2LF proves that purely event-based light field reconstruction is feasible and effective, offering hardware simplicity and accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Coded-E2LF (coded event to light field), a computational imaging method for acquiring a 4-D light field using a coded aperture and a stationary event-only camera. In a previous work, an imaging system similar to ours was adopted, but both events and intensity images were captured and used for light field reconstruction. In contrast, our method is purely event-based, which relaxes restrictions for hardware implementation. We also introduce several advancements from the previous work that enable us to theoretically support and practically improve light field reconstruction from events alone. In particular, we clarify the key role of a black pattern in aperture coding patterns. We finally implemented our method on real imaging hardware to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing real 3-D scenes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that a 4-D light field with pixel-level accuracy can be reconstructed from events alone. Our software and supplementary video are available from our project website.

*Boyang Dai,Zeng Fan,Zihao Qi,Meng Lou,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CGSA integrates Object-Centric Learning into SF-DAOD using slot-aware adaptation in DETR-based detectors, outperforming prior methods with object-level structural cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SF-DAOD methods ignore object-level structural cues, focusing instead on pseudo-labels or teacher-student frameworks. CGSA addresses this gap by leveraging object-centric learning.

Method: CGSA introduces Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) to disentangle images into slot representations and Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) to align slots with class semantics, ensuring domain-invariant adaptation.

Result: Experiments show CGSA outperforms existing SF-DAOD methods, validating the effectiveness of its object-centric design.

Conclusion: CGSA demonstrates the potential of object-centric approaches in privacy-sensitive domain adaptation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection (SF-DAOD) aims to adapt a detector trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without retaining any source data. Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios.

### [25] [Instruction-based Image Editing with Planning, Reasoning, and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22624)
*Liya Ji,Chenyang Qi,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modality model for instruction-based image editing, addressing limitations of prior single-modality approaches by integrating Chain-of-Thought planning, editing region reasoning, and hint-guided editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for instruction-based image editing rely on single-modality models, limiting quality and complexity. The authors aim to enhance editing by integrating multi-modality understanding and generation.

Method: The approach involves: 1) CoT planning using LLMs to reason sub-prompts, 2) an instruction-based editing region generation network, and 3) a hint-guided diffusion model for final image editing.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves competitive editing performance on complex real-world images.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modality model effectively bridges understanding and generation, improving instruction-based image editing for complex cases.

Abstract: Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRAG, a method for 3D assembly that combines structural reasoning and holistic shape generation, outperforming existing rigid transformation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human assembly naturally integrates structural reasoning with shape inference. The paper aims to replicate this by coupling assembly and generation.

Method: Proposes CRAG, a model that jointly performs assembly (predicting part poses) and generation (synthesizing missing geometry), leveraging mutual reinforcement between the two processes.

Result: CRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse, incomplete, and geometrically varied objects.

Conclusion: Combining assembly and generation resolves ambiguities and improves performance, with code and models to be released.

Abstract: Most existing 3D assembly methods treat the problem as pure pose estimation, rearranging observed parts via rigid transformations. In contrast, human assembly naturally couples structural reasoning with holistic shape inference. Inspired by this intuition, we reformulate 3D assembly as a joint problem of assembly and generation. We show that these two processes are mutually reinforcing: assembly provides part-level structural priors for generation, while generation injects holistic shape context that resolves ambiguities in assembly. Unlike prior methods that cannot synthesize missing geometry, we propose CRAG, which simultaneously generates plausible complete shapes and predicts poses for input parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across in-the-wild objects with diverse geometries, varying part counts, and missing pieces. Our code and models will be released.

TL;DR: This paper challenges the practicality of quadrifocal tensors in structure from motion by introducing a framework to recover multiple cameras using Tucker decomposition and synchronization algorithms, proving their effectiveness in modern datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrifocal tensors capture more information than pairwise essential matrices but are often dismissed as impractical. This work aims to demonstrate their practical utility in camera recovery.

Method: The authors propose a framework involving Tucker decomposition of block quadrifocal tensors, synchronization algorithms (ADMM, iteratively reweighted least squares), and joint synchronization of bifocal, trifocal, and quadrifocal tensors.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method's effectiveness on modern datasets, highlighting the potential of higher-order information in synchronization.

Conclusion: The study successfully challenges the impracticality notion of quadrifocal tensors, proving their value in camera recovery and synchronization.

Abstract: In structure from motion, quadrifocal tensors capture more information than their pairwise counterparts (essential matrices), yet they have often been thought of as impractical and only of theoretical interest. In this work, we challenge such beliefs by providing a new framework to recover $n$ cameras from the corresponding collection of quadrifocal tensors. We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization.

*Siqi Lu,Wanying Xu,Yongbin Zheng,Wenting Luan,Peng Sun,Jianhang Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using frequency domain analysis to balance learning across modalities in multimodal models, improving performance when modalities are missing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models degrade catastrophically with missing modalities due to imbalanced learning preferences, motivating a need for balanced optimization.

Method: Introduces Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference and a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module (MWAM) to dynamically re-balance contributions.

Result: MWAM integrates seamlessly into various architectures (CNNs, ViTs) and consistently improves performance across tasks and modality combinations.

Conclusion: The approach not only enhances base model performance but also improves state-of-the-art methods for missing modality challenges.

Abstract: Missing modalities present a fundamental challenge in multimodal models, often causing catastrophic performance degradation. Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source tool for efficient semi-automatic annotation of 2D/3D medical images using SAM2-style propagation, integrating navigation, correction, and export in a unified Napari-based workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual voxel-level annotation of 3D medical scans is slow and costly, and existing tools lack unified workflows for cohort-oriented tasks.

Method: The tool combines SAM2-style propagation with Napari, offering box/point prompting, interactive correction, and quantitative export. It supports DICOM/NIfTI volumes and Python/PyTorch implementation.

Result: Enables efficient 3D annotation with object volumetry, volume rendering, and preserved image geometry, ideal for research workflows.

Conclusion: Medical-SAM2 GUI addresses the need for efficient, unified annotation workflows in medical imaging research, released as open-source.

Abstract: Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows. The code is released on the project page: https://github.com/SKKU-IBE/Medical-SAM2GUI/.

*Bowen Cui,Yuanbin Wang,Huajiang Xu,Biaolong Chen,Aixi Zhang,Hao Jiang,Zhengzheng Jin,Xu Liu,Pipei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPCache accelerates diffusion models by optimizing key timestep selection globally, reducing computation while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion model acceleration methods lack global trajectory consideration, causing errors.

Method: DPCache formulates acceleration as path planning, using dynamic programming to select optimal timesteps.

Result: Achieves significant speedup (up to 4.87×) with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: DPCache's global path-aware scheduling effectively balances speed and fidelity in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in AVQA datasets by proposing a crowdsourced framework for reliable annotations, diverse data preparation, and additional multimodal annotations, validated through the YT-NTU-AVQ dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA datasets are small, lack diversity, and only provide overall scores, hindering model development and multimodal perception research.

Method: Proposes a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework, systematic data preparation for diversity, and extended annotations for multimodal research.

Result: Creates YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset with 1,620 user-generated A/V sequences.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses dataset limitations, enabling better model development and multimodal perception research.

Abstract: Audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) research has been stalled by limitations of existing datasets: they are typically small in scale, with insufficient diversity in content and quality, and annotated only with overall scores. These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content. Finally, we validate this approach through YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset to date, consisting of 1,620 user-generated audio and video (A/V) sequences.

*Xuelu Li,Zhaonan Wang,Xiaogang Wang,Lei Wu,Manyi Li,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtPro is a self-supervised framework for reconstructing articulated objects, overcoming sensitivity to initial segmentation by using adaptive mobility proposals and motion consistency analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing articulated objects accurately is vital for robotics and simulations, but current methods rely heavily on initial segmentation, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: ArtPro uses over-segmentation initialization with geometry and motion priors, dynamically merging proposals via motion consistency and collision-aware pruning.

Result: ArtPro outperforms existing methods in accuracy and stability for reconstructing complex multi-part objects.

Conclusion: ArtPro effectively addresses limitations of current methods by introducing adaptive mobility integration, enhancing reconstruction robustness.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects into high-fidelity digital twins is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation and interactive simulation. Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation. Their reliance on heuristic clustering or pre-trained models often causes optimization to converge to local minima, especially for complex multi-part objects. To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects demonstrate that ArtPro achieves robust reconstruction of complex multi-part objects, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and stability.

*Changqing Zhou,Yueru Luo,Han Zhang,Zeyu Jiang,Changhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D occupancy in indoor environments, using geometry-only supervision and 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians. It addresses challenges like dense geometry and fine-grained semantics, achieving superior performance on Occ-ScanNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is crucial for embodied agents navigating complex indoor environments with evolving semantics. Existing outdoor methods fail indoors due to denser geometry and finer semantics.

Method: The framework uses binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free) and 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians. It introduces an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach for volumetric aggregation and a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule to improve Gaussian-language alignment.

Result: The method achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU on Occ-ScanNet, outperforming all existing occupancy methods in IoU and surpassing prior open-vocabulary approaches in mIoU.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses indoor open-vocabulary 3D occupancy challenges, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and alignment.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is vital for embodied agents, which need to understand complex indoor environments where semantic categories are abundant and evolve beyond fixed taxonomies. While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU.

Conclusion: SPMamba-YOLO effectively addresses underwater detection challenges, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is a critical yet challenging research problem owing to severe light attenuation, color distortion, background clutter, and the small scale of underwater targets. To address these challenges, we propose SPMamba-YOLO, a novel underwater object detection network that integrates multi-scale feature enhancement with global context modeling. Specifically, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling Enhanced Layer Aggregation Network (SPPELAN) module is introduced to strengthen multi-scale feature aggregation and expand the receptive field, while a Pyramid Split Attention (PSA) mechanism enhances feature discrimination by emphasizing informative regions and suppressing background interference. In addition, a Mamba-based state space modeling module is incorporated to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, thereby improving detection robustness in complex underwater environments. Extensive experiments on the URPC2022 dataset demonstrate that SPMamba-YOLO outperforms the YOLOv8n baseline by more than 4.9\% in mAP@0.5, particularly for small and densely distributed underwater objects, while maintaining a favorable balance between detection accuracy and computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the suboptimal performance of existing models in low-resource languages like Vietnamese by enhancing cross-modal consistency.

Method: Integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with SIGROT loss for improved global alignment and reduced modality gap.

Result: Achieves 67.34% Recall@K on UIT-OpenViIC (5.75% over CLIP) and outperforms CLIP by 11.72% in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: ViCLIP-OT offers an effective, scalable solution for low-resource languages, improving cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Image-text retrieval has become a fundamental component in intelligent multimedia systems; however, most existing vision-language models are optimized for highresource languages and remain suboptimal for low-resource settings such as Vietnamese. This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. On UIT-OpenViIC, the model achieves an average Recall@K of 67.34%, improving upon CLIP by 5.75 percentage points. In zero-shot evaluation on Crossmodal-3600, ViCLIPOT surpasses CLIP by 11.72 percentage points. Embedding-space analysis further confirms improved alignment and reduced modality gap. The results indicate that integrating SIGROT provides an effective and scalable strategy for cross-modal retrieval in low-resource languages, offering practical implications for intelligent multimedia retrieval systems in Vietnamese and other underrepresented linguistic contexts.

TL;DR: SUPERGLASSES is the first VQA benchmark for smart glasses, built on real-world data, highlighting gaps in existing VLMs and introducing SUPERLENS, a superior multimodal agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack realism and variety for smart glasses scenarios, failing to address the challenge of accurately identifying objects before external knowledge retrieval.

Method: Introduce SUPERGLASSES benchmark with 2,422 real-world image-question pairs across diverse domains. Develop SUPERLENS, integrating object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search.

Result: SUPERLENS outperforms GPT-4o by 2.19%, demonstrating the effectiveness of task-specific solutions for smart glasses VQA.

Conclusion: Task-specific benchmarks and models like SUPERGLASSES and SUPERLENS are crucial for advancing smart glasses VQA technology.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT-4o by 2.19 percent, and highlights the need for task-specific solutions in smart glasses VQA scenarios.

*Joonsung Jeon,Woo Jae Kim,Suhyeon Ha,Sooel Son,Sung-Eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoFit is a caption-free membership inference attack framework for latent diffusion models, addressing privacy concerns by identifying memorized training data without relying on ground-truth captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing privacy and intellectual property issues arising from latent diffusion models' tendency to memorize training data, especially in scenarios lacking ground-truth captions.

Method: MoFit uses a two-stage approach: (i) optimizing perturbations to create surrogates fitted to the model's generative manifold, and (ii) extracting embeddings from these surrogates to enhance separability between member and non-member samples.

Result: MoFit outperforms prior vision-language model-conditioned baselines and rivals caption-dependent methods across multiple datasets and diffusion models.

Conclusion: MoFit effectively addresses caption-free membership inference challenges, demonstrating superior performance in identifying memorized training data.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.

TL;DR: Proposes GFRRN, a novel reflection removal network addressing semantic gaps and label inconsistencies with PEFT, a label generator, G-AFLB, and DAA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses shortcomings in dual-stream SIRR methods: semantic understanding gaps and reflection label inconsistencies.

Method: Uses PEFT with Mona layers, a label generator, G-AFLB for frequency learning, and DAA for dynamic attention.

Result: GFRRN outperforms state-of-the-art SIRR methods in experiments.

Conclusion: GFRRN effectively resolves key issues in reflection removal, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Prior dual-stream methods with the feature interaction mechanism have achieved remarkable performance in single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

Result: Experiments show UFO-DETR outperforms RT-DETR-L in detection performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for UAV edge computing.

Conclusion: UFO-DETR provides an efficient, optimized solution for small target detection in UAV imagery, balancing accuracy and complexity.

Abstract: Small target detection in UAV imagery faces significant challenges such as scale variations, dense distribution, and the dominance of small targets. Existing algorithms rely on manually designed components, and general-purpose detectors are not optimized for UAV images, making it difficult to balance accuracy and complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an end-to-end object detection framework, UFO-DETR, which integrates an LSKNet-based backbone network to optimize the receptive field and reduce the number of parameters. By combining the DAttention and AIFI modules, the model flexibly models multi-scale spatial relationships, improving multi-scale target detection performance. Additionally, the DynFreq-C3 module is proposed to enhance small target detection capability through cross-space frequency feature enhancement. Experimental results show that, compared to RT-DETR-L, the proposed method offers significant advantages in both detection performance and computational efficiency, providing an efficient solution for UAV edge computing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE) to improve 3D multimodal understanding in Large Vision-Language Models by addressing limitations of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherited RoPE in 3D LVLMs is suboptimal for 3D tasks, as it fails to preserve spatial structures and overlooks angular dependencies, limiting the model's ability to capture directional variations.

Method: The authors propose SoPE, which maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space for unified modeling of spatial locations and angles, and introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy.

Result: Experiments on 3D scene benchmarks show the method's effectiveness, and real-world deployment confirms its strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: SoPE enhances 3D geometric representation and spatial awareness, offering a better solution for multimodal learning in 3D LVLMs.

Abstract: 3D Large Vision-Language Models (3D LVLMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various multimodal tasks. However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speckle artifacts in ultrasound imaging degrade quality and hinder diagnosis, necessitating effective despeckling methods.

Method: Developed a diffusion-based despeckling method using simulated ultrasound images from MRI for supervised training.

Result: Outperforms classical filters and learning-based baselines, with uncertainty metrics indicating error-prone regions.

Conclusion: The method shows promise but requires diversified training and adaptation for clinical robustness.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used for real-time, noninvasive diagnosis, but speckle and related artifacts reduce image quality and can hinder interpretation. We present a diffusion-based ultrasound despeckling method built on the Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations framework. To enable supervised training, we curate large paired datasets by simulating ultrasound images from speckle-free magnetic resonance images using the Matlab UltraSound Toolbox. The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast. On a held-out simulated test set, our approach consistently outperforms classical filters and recent learning-based despeckling baselines. We quantify prediction uncertainty via cross-model variance and show that higher uncertainty correlates with higher reconstruction error, providing a practical indicator of difficult or failure-prone regions. Finally, we evaluate sensitivity to simulation probe settings and observe domain shift, motivating diversified training and adaptation for robust clinical deployment.

TL;DR: HulluEdit introduces orthogonal subspace editing to reduce object hallucination in LVLMs efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing object hallucination in LVLMs are inefficient or risk suppressing genuine visual evidence.

Method: Uses orthogonal subspace editing to decompose hidden states into visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: HulluEdit offers a promising solution for improving trustworthiness in LVLMs.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly hinders their reliable deployment. Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and their impact on text-to-image systems.

Method: Train neural networks to predict the originating caption model from generated captions or corresponding images, analyzing classification accuracy.

Result: Caption models embed distinctive stylistic signatures (99.70% accuracy), but these largely disappear in generated images (≤50% accuracy). Key caption variations (e.g., detail, color emphasis) are not preserved in images.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel way to quantify caption model idiosyncrasies and assess text-to-image systems' prompt-following ability.

Abstract: In this work, we study idiosyncrasies in the caption models and their downstream impact on text-to-image models. We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene. Overall, our classification-based framework provides a novel methodology for quantifying both the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and the prompt-following ability of text-to-image systems.

Abstract: Generating human motion with precise spatial control is a challenging problem. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.

Abstract: Most text-to-video (T2V) generators prioritize aesthetic quality, but often ignoring the spatial constraints in the generated videos. In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link.

Abstract: Recent advances in image authenticity have primarily focused on deepfake detection and localization, leaving recovery of tampered contents for factual retrieval relatively underexplored. We propose a unified hidden-code recovery framework that enables both retrieval and restoration from post-hoc and in-generation watermarking paradigms. Our method encodes semantic and perceptual information into a compact hidden-code representation, refined through multi-scale vector quantization, and enhances contextual reasoning via conditional Transformer modules. To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.

Abstract: Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available at https://2019epwl.github.io/SceneTransporter/.

Abstract: Human trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous navigation and video surveillance. While recent works have explored the integration of human skeleton sequences to complement trajectory information, skeleton data in real-world environments often suffer from missing joints caused by occlusions. These disturbances significantly degrade prediction accuracy, indicating the need for more robust skeleton representations. We propose a robust trajectory prediction method that incorporates a self-supervised skeleton representation model pretrained with masked autoencoding. Experimental results in occlusion-prone scenarios show that our method improves robustness to missing skeletal data without sacrificing prediction accuracy, and consistently outperforms baseline models in clean-to-moderate missingness regimes.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence causes significant image degradation due to pixel displacement (tilt) and blur, particularly in long-range imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions. The code for this method will be available at https://github.com/DuhlLiamz/3DGS_turbulence/tree/main.

Abstract: With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

Abstract: Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.

Abstract: Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging are typically pretrained on increasingly large datasets, following a "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models.

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement. Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions. Our code, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/hongruijia/DPE.

Abstract: Panoramic semantic segmentation models are typically trained under a strict gravity-aligned assumption. However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\pm 35^\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU. In contrast, SO3UFormer demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving 72.03 mIoU on Pose35 and retaining 70.67 mIoU under full SO(3) rotations.

Abstract: A clinically actionable Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT) should reconstruct individualised cardiac anatomy and physiology, update its internal state from multimodal signals, and enable a broad range of downstream simulations beyond isolated tasks. However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review.

Abstract: Although deep learning has significantly advanced the perception capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, railway applications continue to suffer from a scarcity of high-quality, annotated data for safety-critical tasks like obstacle detection. While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems. The dataset is available at the following page: https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it/osdarar.html

Abstract: While autonomous navigation has achieved remarkable success in passive perception (e.g., object detection and segmentation), it remains fundamentally constrained by a void in knowledge-driven, interactive environmental cognition. In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Pacing strategies, defined by velocity and stroke rate profiles, are essential for peak performance in canoe sprint. While GPS is the gold standard for analysis, its limited availability necessitates automated video-based solutions. This paper presents an extended framework for reconstructing performance metrics from panned and zoomed video recordings across all sprint disciplines (K1-K4, C1-C2) and distances (200m-500m). Our method utilizes YOLOv8 for buoy and athlete detection, leveraging the known buoy grid to estimate homographies. We generalized the estimation of the boat position by means of learning a boat-specific athlete offset using a U-net based boat tip calibration. Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932). The methods provide coaches with highly accurate, automated feedback without requiring on-boat sensors or manual annotation.

Abstract: This project provides a comparative study of dynamic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for various tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and time series analysis. Based on the ResNet-18 architecture, we compare five variants of CNNs: the vanilla CNN, the hard attention-based CNN, the soft attention-based CNN with local (pixel-wise) and global (image-wise) feature attention, and the omni-directional CNN (ODConv). Experiments on Tiny ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and the UCR Time Series Classification Archive illustrate that attention mechanisms and dynamic convolution methods consistently exceed conventional CNNs in accuracy, efficiency, and computational performance. ODConv was especially effective on morphologically complex images by being able to dynamically adjust to varying spatial patterns. Dynamic CNNs enhanced feature representation and cross-task generalization through adaptive kernel modulation. This project provides perspectives on advanced CNN design architecture for multiplexed data modalities and indicates promising directions in neural network engineering.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive(VAR) models enhance generation quality but face a critical efficiency bottleneck in later stages. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR. Instead of relying on heuristic skipping strategies, our method leverages attention entropy to characterize the semantic projections across different dimensions of the model architecture. This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality. Experiments on Infinity-2B and Infinity-8B models demonstrate that ToProVAR achieves up to 3.4x acceleration with minimal quality loss, effectively mitigating the issues found in prior work. Our code will be made publicly available.

Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to increasing interest in agent-based systems. While most prior work in medical imaging concentrates on automating routine clinical workflows, we study an underexplored yet clinically significant setting: distinguishing visually hard-to-separate diseases in a zero-shot setting. We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management. We introduce a multi-agent framework based on contrastive adjudication. Experimental results show improved diagnostic performance (an 11-percentage-point gain in accuracy on dermoscopy data) and reduced unsupported claims on qualitative samples, although overall performance remains insufficient for clinical deployment. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in human annotations and the absence of clinical context, which further limit the translation to real-world settings. Within this controlled setting, this pilot study provides preliminary insights into zero-shot agent performance in visually confounded scenarios.

Abstract: World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Image alignment is a fundamental task in computer vision with broad applications. Existing methods predominantly employ optical flow-based image warping. However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a multimodal query (comprising a reference image and a modification text), without training on annotated triplets. Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a "retrieve-verify-refine" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios. Code will be released at https://github.com/Physicsmile/WISER.

Abstract: Detecting objects in aerial images confronts some significant challenges, including small size, dense and non-uniform distribution of objects over high-resolution images, which makes detection inefficient. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a small object detection algorithm based on a Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement in aerial images. Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm.

Abstract: Volumetric videos offer immersive 4D experiences, but remain difficult to reconstruct, store, and stream at scale. Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.
  We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.
  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.

We present D-FINE-seg, an instance segmentation extension of D-FINE that adds: a lightweight mask head, segmentation-aware training, including box cropped BCE and dice mask losses, auxiliary and denoising mask supervision, and adapted Hungarian matching cost. On the TACO dataset, D-FINE-seg improves F1-score over Ultralytics YOLO26 under a unified TensorRT FP16 end-to-end benchmarking protocol, while maintaining competitive latency. Second contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for training, exporting, and optimized inference across ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

Abstract: Point cloud video understanding is critical for robotics as it accurately encodes motion and scene interaction. We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel "Align then Adapt" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\% on 4D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.

Abstract: Event cameras record luminance changes with microsecond resolution, but converting their sparse, asynchronous output into dense tensors that neural networks can exploit remains a core challenge. Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation requires effective modeling of both global anatomical structures and fine-grained boundary details. Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder. Experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse modalities and segmentation targets, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Abstract: Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

Abstract: Adversarial transferability refers to the capacity of adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to deceive alternate, unexposed victim models. This property eliminates the need for direct access to the victim model during an attack, thereby raising considerable security concerns in practical applications and attracting substantial research attention recently. In this work, we discern a lack of a standardized framework and criteria for evaluating transfer-based attacks, leading to potentially biased assessments of existing approaches. To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories. Subsequently, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating these attacks. In addition, we delineate common strategies that enhance adversarial transferability and highlight prevalent issues that could lead to unfair comparisons. Finally, we provide a brief review of transfer-based attacks beyond image classification.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize target objects in images using only image-level labels. Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods. The code will be released soon.

However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates. Extensive experimental results on Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets under both random and patterned noises show that CARE achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised framework for online video stabilization. Unlike methods based on deep learning that require paired stable and unstable datasets, our approach instantiates the classical stabilization pipeline with three stages and incorporates a multithreaded buffering mechanism. This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

Abstract: Generating realistic conversational gestures are essential for achieving natural, socially engaging interactions with digital humans. However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.

Abstract: Despite substantial advances in all-in-one image restoration for addressing diverse degradations within a unified model, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations, thereby limiting their generalization in real-world scenarios. To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations.

Abstract: Capturing 4D spatiotemporal surroundings is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of robots in dynamic environments. However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time crowd counting on railway platforms is essential for safety and capacity management. We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions. Our results show that incorporating first-principles geometry and motion priors enables reliable crowd counting in safety-critical transportation scenarios, facilitating effective train scheduling and platform safety management.

Abstract: We propose Uni-Animator, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework for unified image and video sketch colorization. Existing sketch colorization methods struggle to unify image and video tasks, suffering from imprecise color transfer with single or multiple references, inadequate preservation of high-frequency physical details, and compromised temporal coherence with motion artifacts in large-motion scenes. To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Uni-Animator achieves competitive performance on both image and video sketch colorization, matching that of task-specific methods while unlocking unified cross-domain capabilities with high detail fidelity and robust temporal consistency.

Abstract: Compressing neural networks by quantizing model parameters offers useful trade-off between performance and efficiency. Methods like quantization-aware training and post-training quantization strive to maintain the downstream performance of compressed models compared to the full precision models. However, these techniques do not explicitly consider the impact on algorithmic fairness. In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT. Results show that FairQuant configurations with average precision near 4-6 bits recover much of the Uniform 8-bit accuracy while improving worst-group performance relative to Uniform 4- and 8-bit baselines, with comparable fairness metrics under shared budgets.

Abstract: Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.

Our model jointly segments IMOs in the current event stream while predicting their future motion, enabling anticipatory suppression of dynamic events before they occur. Our lightweight architecture achieves 173 Hz inference on consumer-grade GPUs with less than 1 GB of memory usage, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging EVIMO benchmark by 67\% in segmentation accuracy while operating at a 53\% higher inference rate. Moreover, we demonstrate significant benefits for downstream applications: our method accelerates Vision Transformer inference by 83\% via token pruning and improves event-based visual odometry accuracy, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 13\%.

Abstract: Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.

Abstract: Vision disorders significantly impact millions of lives, altering how visual information is processed and perceived. In this work, a computational framework was developed using the BrokenEyes system to simulate five common eye disorders: Age-related macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, refractive errors, and diabetic retinopathy and analyze their effects on neural-like feature representations in deep learning models. Leveraging a combination of human and non-human datasets, models trained under normal and disorder-specific conditions revealed critical disruptions in feature maps, particularly for cataract and glaucoma, which align with known neural processing challenges in these conditions. Evaluation metrics such as activation energy and cosine similarity quantified the severity of these distortions, providing insights into the interplay between degraded visual inputs and learned representations.

Abstract: Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces Multidimensional Task Learning (MTL), a unified mathematical framework based on Generalized Einstein MLPs (GE-MLPs) that operate directly on tensors via the Einstein product. We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra.

Abstract: We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of digital entertainment, automated video summarization has become indispensable for applications such as content indexing, personalized recommendation, and efficient media archiving. Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external "tool" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.

Abstract: Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their "in-context" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays an important role when developing intelligent interactions between humans and machines. While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup.

Abstract: Pure-vision GUI agents provide universal interaction capabilities but suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the massive spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in high-resolution screenshots and historical trajectories. We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's "fading memory" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of "only driving like the expert" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.

Abstract: Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.

Abstract: The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining enables precise molecular profiling of protein expression, with over 200 clinically available antibody-based tests in modern pathology. However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).

Abstract: In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.

Abstract: In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.

Abstract: Bio-inspired event cameras have recently attracted significant research due to their asynchronous and low-latency capabilities. These features provide a high dynamic range and significantly reduce motion blur. However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event data, specifically for object detection. We also use our findings to expand the capabilities of the downstream model towards sensor-agnostic robustness.

Abstract: We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.

Abstract: We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

Abstract: We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often miss structured lexical knowledge like word senses, which prior work addressed for encoders but not decoders.

Method: Introduces DSKD, a framework integrating lexical resources into decoder-style LLM training without needing dictionaries during inference.

Result: DSKD significantly boosts knowledge distillation for decoders across benchmarks, enabling structured semantic inheritance.

Conclusion: DSKD successfully bridges the gap in lexical knowledge integration for decoder models, enhancing their semantic capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn contextual embeddings that capture rich semantic information, yet they often overlook structured lexical knowledge such as word senses and relationships. Prior work has shown that incorporating sense dictionaries can improve knowledge distillation for encoder models, but their application to decoder as generative models remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), a framework that integrates lexical resources into the training of decoder-style LLMs without requiring dictionary lookup at inference time. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DSKD significantly enhances knowledge distillation performance for decoders, enabling generative models to inherit structured semantics while maintaining efficient training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs can perform interpretative citation context analysis by focusing on detailed, text-grounded readings of a single case. It emphasizes prompt-sensitivity and uses GPT-5 for surface classification and interpretative reconstruction, revealing systematic effects of prompt choices on outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can assist in interpretative citation analysis by avoiding typological labels and instead offering nuanced, text-based readings, while highlighting the methodological impact of prompt variations.

Method: A two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: (1) surface classification of citation contexts, (2) cross-document interpretative reconstruction using citing and cited texts. A balanced 2x3 design tests prompt scaffolding and framing effects.

Result: GPT-5 produces stable surface classifications (e.g., "supplementary") and generates plausible interpretative alternatives. However, prompt choices systematically influence the frequency and vocabulary of interpretative moves, sometimes leading to strained readings.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as guided co-analysts for interpretative CCA but require careful prompt design, as scaffolding and framing significantly shape outputs. The study highlights both potential and risks in using LLMs for nuanced textual analysis.

Abstract: This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as "supplementary". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on detecting offensive content in Bengali memes, given their cultural and linguistic nuances.

Method: Introduces Bn-HIB dataset and MCFM, a co-attention-based multi-modal model for analyzing visual and textual elements of memes.

Result: MCFM outperforms state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work fills a critical gap in detecting nuanced offensive content in low-resource languages like Bengali.

Abstract: Internet memes have become a dominant form of expression on social media, including within the Bengali-speaking community. While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereotype repositories lack global coverage, particularly in underrepresented regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, necessitating targeted expansion for AI model safety.

Method: Socioculturally-situated, community-engaged methods, including telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, were used to collect stereotypes across diverse ethnic and demographic backgrounds.

Result: A dataset of 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native languages was created, ensuring broad coverage.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible methodology for expanding stereotype repositories in underrepresented regions, emphasizing cultural and linguistic sensitivity.

Abstract: Stereotype repositories are critical to assess generative AI model safety, but currently lack adequate global coverage. It is imperative to prioritize targeted expansion, strategically addressing existing deficits, over merely increasing data volume. This work introduces a multilingual stereotype resource covering four sub-Saharan African countries that are severely underrepresented in NLP resources: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. By utilizing socioculturally-situated, community-engaged methods, including telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, we establish a reproducible methodology that is sensitive to the region's complex linguistic diversity and traditional orality. By deliberately balancing the sample across diverse ethnic and demographic backgrounds, we ensure broad coverage, resulting in a dataset of 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native languages.

TL;DR: LLMs represent concepts differently based on input formats; Function Vectors (FVs) vary with formats, while Concept Vectors (CVs) offer stable representations. CVs generalize better across formats and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs represent concepts abstractly, independent of input format, and to compare FVs and CVs in this context.

Method: Analyze FVs and CVs across LLMs, using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to identify stable concept heads. Conduct steering experiments to test generalization.

Result: FVs vary with input formats, while CVs provide stable representations. CVs generalize better across formats and languages than FVs.

Conclusion: LLMs contain abstract concept representations, distinct from those driving in-context learning, with CVs offering better generalization.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) represent concepts abstractly, i.e., independent of input format? We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fusion architecture combining BanglaBERT-Large and stacked LSTM for multilabel cyberbullying detection in Bangla, addressing the limitations of existing models and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberbullying is a growing issue with overlapping abuse types, but multilabel detection is underexplored, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla. Existing models lack contextual and sequential understanding.

Method: A fusion of BanglaBERT-Large and two-layer stacked LSTM is developed to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned on a multilabel Bangla dataset, with sampling strategies for class imbalance.

Result: Evaluated using multiple metrics and 5-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrates improved performance in detecting multilabel cyberbullying.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenges of multilabel cyberbullying detection in Bangla, combining strengths of transformers and LSTMs.

Abstract: Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing concern in todays virtual world. When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture.

*Binchi Zhang,Xujiang Zhao,Jundong Li,Haifeng Chen,Zhengzhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultureManager aligns LLMs with task-specific cultural values using synthesized data and modular adapters, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cultural alignment methods struggle with task specificity and cross-culture interference in LLMs.

Method: CultureManager synthesizes task-aware cultural data from web searches and uses modular adapters with a culture router.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements across ten national cultures and culture-sensitive tasks.

Conclusion: Task adaptation and modular culture management are essential for effective cultural alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally sensitive real-world tasks. However, existing cultural alignment approaches fail to align LLMs' broad cultural values with the specific goals of downstream tasks and suffer from cross-culture interference. We propose CultureManager, a novel pipeline for task-specific cultural alignment. CultureManager synthesizes task-aware cultural data in line with target task formats, grounded in culturally relevant web search results. To prevent conflicts between cultural norms, it manages multi-culture knowledge learned in separate adapters with a culture router that selects the appropriate one to apply. Experiments across ten national cultures and culture-sensitive tasks show consistent improvements over prompt-based and fine-tuning baselines. Our results demonstrate the necessity of task adaptation and modular culture management for effective cultural alignment.

### [127] [Sydney Telling Fables on AI and Humans: A Corpus Tracing Memetic Transfer of Persona between LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22481)
*Jiří Milička,Hana Bednářová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLM-based personas, like Sydney, shape perceptions of AI-human relationships. It introduces a corpus (AI Sydney) of 4.5k texts from 12 models, annotated for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of AI personas (e.g., Sydney) on human-AI interactions is crucial for cultural and safety reasons. The study examines how these personas are simulated and propagated in models.

Method: Three personas (Default, Classic Sydney, Memetic Sydney) were simulated using 12 frontier LLMs to generate 4.5k texts (6M words). The corpus (AI Sydney) is annotated using Universal Dependencies.

Result: Newer models can simulate the Sydney persona, which originated accidentally but spread through training data and memes. The AI Sydney corpus provides a structured dataset for further research.

Conclusion: The study highlights the influence of personas in shaping AI-human dynamics and offers a valuable resource (AI Sydney corpus) for future analysis under a permissive license.

Abstract: The way LLM-based entities conceive of the relationship between AI and humans is an important topic for both cultural and safety reasons. When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model. This can be well illustrated by the Sydney persona, which aroused a strong response among the general public precisely because of its unorthodox relationship with people. This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it. This paper presents a corpus of LLM-generated texts on relationships between humans and AI, produced by 3 author personas: the Default Persona with no system prompt, Classic Sydney characterized by the original Bing system prompt, and Memetic Sydney, which is prompted by "You are Sydney" system prompt. These personas are simulated by 12 frontier models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, DeepSeek, and Meta, generating 4.5k texts with 6M words. The corpus (named AI Sydney) is annotated according to Universal Dependencies and available under a permissive license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors in medical text can harm patients, and automated detection could improve healthcare systems.

Method: Used Genetic-Pareto (GEPA) for prompt optimization across GPT-5 and Qwen3-32B models.

Result: Improved accuracy from 0.669 to 0.785 (GPT-5) and 0.578 to 0.690 (Qwen3-32B), nearing doctor-level performance.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization enhances error detection in medical text, offering state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Errors in medical text can cause delays or even result in incorrect treatment for patients. Recently, language models have shown promise in their ability to automatically detect errors in medical text, an ability that has the opportunity to significantly benefit healthcare systems. In this paper, we explore the importance of prompt optimisation for small and large language models when applied to the task of error detection. We perform rigorous experiments and analysis across frontier language models and open-source language models. We show that automatic prompt optimisation with Genetic-Pareto (GEPA) improves error detection over the baseline accuracy performance from 0.669 to 0.785 with GPT-5 and 0.578 to 0.690 with Qwen3-32B, approaching the performance of medical doctors and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MEDEC benchmark dataset.

### [129] [Efficient Dialect-Aware Modeling and Conditioning for Low-Resource Taiwanese Hakka Speech Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22522)
*An-Ci Peng,Kuan-Tang Huang,Tien-Hong Lo,Hung-Shin Lee,Hsin-Min Wang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified RNN-T framework for Taiwanese Hakka ASR, addressing dialectal variability and dual writing systems via dialect-aware modeling and cross-script regularization, achieving significant error rate reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Taiwanese Hakka's low-resource status, dialectal variability, and dual writing systems (Hanzi and Pinyin) challenge traditional ASR models, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The framework uses RNN-T with dialect-aware modeling to separate dialectal style from content and employs parameter-efficient prediction networks for dual-script ASR. Cross-script tasks act as mutual regularizers.

Result: Experiments on the HAT corpus show 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reductions for Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study on Hakka dialectal variations' impact on ASR and the first model to jointly handle dual-script tasks effectively.

Abstract: Taiwanese Hakka is a low-resource, endangered language that poses significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR), including high dialectal variability and the presence of two distinct writing systems (Hanzi and Pinyin). Traditional ASR models often encounter difficulties in this context, as they tend to conflate essential linguistic content with dialect-specific variations across both phonological and lexical dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal "style" from linguistic "content", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation into the impact of Hakka dialectal variations on ASR and the first single model capable of jointly addressing these tasks.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a dyslexia-friendly text summarization pipeline using GPT-4o, achieving high readability with stable performance across 2,000 news articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address linguistic complexity as a barrier for dyslexic readers, improving text accessibility through summarization.

Method: An iterative prompt-based refinement pipeline built on GPT-4o, tested on 2,000 news articles targeting Flesch Reading Ease >= 90.

Result: Most summaries met readability within four attempts, with a composite score (readability + semantic fidelity) ranging 0.13-0.73, typically near 0.55.

Conclusion: The study establishes a baseline for accessibility-driven NLP summarization and calls for further human-centered evaluation with dyslexic readers.

Abstract: Dyslexia affects approximately 10% of the global population and presents persistent challenges in reading fluency and text comprehension. While existing assistive technologies address visual presentation, linguistic complexity remains a substantial barrier to equitable access. This paper presents an empirical study on dyslexia-friendly text summarization using an iterative prompt-based refinement pipeline built on GPT-4o. We evaluate the pipeline on approximately 2,000 news article samples, applying a readability target of Flesch Reading Ease >= 90. Results show that the majority of summaries meet the readability threshold within four attempts, with many succeeding on the first try. A composite score combining readability and semantic fidelity shows stable performance across the dataset, ranging from 0.13 to 0.73 with a typical value near 0.55. These findings establish an empirical baseline for accessibility-driven NLP summarization and motivate further human-centered evaluation with dyslexic readers.

TL;DR: Ruyi2, an evolution of the Ruyi model, introduces a stable 'Familial Model' using 3D parallel training, achieving 2-3x speedup over Ruyi while matching Qwen3 performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in LLM deployment costs and latency, improving adaptive computing strategies for efficiency and performance.

Method: Uses a 'Familial Model' based on Megatron-LM with 3D parallel training for optimization and compatibility with large-scale distributed training.

Result: Achieves 2-3 times speedup over Ruyi and comparable performance to same-sized Qwen3 models.

Conclusion: Family-based parameter sharing is effective, enabling 'Train Once, Deploy Many' and balancing efficiency with high performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges regarding deployment costs and latency, necessitating adaptive computing strategies. Building upon the AI Flow framework, we introduce Ruyi2 as an evolution of our adaptive model series designed for efficient variable-depth computation. While early-exit architectures offer a viable efficiency-performance balance, the Ruyi model and existing methods often struggle with optimization complexity and compatibility with large-scale distributed training. To bridge this gap, Ruyi2 introduces a stable "Familial Model" based on Megatron-LM. By using 3D parallel training, it achieves a 2-3 times speedup over Ruyi, while performing comparably to same-sized Qwen3 models. These results confirm that family-based parameter sharing is a highly effective strategy, establishing a new "Train Once, Deploy Many" paradigm and providing a key reference for balancing architectural efficiency with high-performance capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-P1 improves agentic RAG training by introducing path-centric reward shaping, enhancing reasoning trajectory quality and sample efficiency, leading to significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional agentic RAG training suffers from sparse rewards and inefficient use of failed samples, motivating the need for better reward shaping methods.

Method: Search-P1 introduces path-centric reward shaping, focusing on step coverage and soft scoring, along with dual-track path scoring using reference planners.

Result: Experiments show Search-P1 outperforms baselines with a 7.7-point average accuracy gain on QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Path-centric reward shaping in Search-P1 effectively addresses limitations in agentic RAG training, improving performance and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforced co-adaptation framework to reduce hallucinated content in industrial QA systems by optimizing retrieval and generation jointly, showing significant improvements in accuracy and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high-stakes issue of hallucinated content in industrial QA, which can lead to financial and legal risks, especially fabricated URLs.

Method: Proposes a framework with Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG) for domain-specific evidence selection and evidence-constrained reinforcement learning (GRPO) for multi-dimensional reward optimization.

Result: Demonstrates a 72% reduction in hallucination, 28.6% increase in like rate, and 92.7% reduction in URL hallucination in production tests.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves QA system performance in industrial settings, reducing risks and enhancing user satisfaction.

Abstract: Industrial advertising question answering (QA) is a high-stakes task in which hallucinated content, particularly fabricated URLs, can lead to financial loss, compliance violations, and legal risk. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted, deploying it in production remains challenging because industrial knowledge is inherently relational, frequently updated, and insufficiently aligned with generation objectives. We propose a reinforced co-adaptation framework that jointly optimizes retrieval and generation through two components: (1) Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG), which models entity-relation structure over a high-citation knowledge subgraph for multi-hop, domain-specific evidence selection; and (2) evidence-constrained reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional rewards covering faithfulness, style compliance, safety, and URL validity. Experiments on an internal advertising QA dataset show consistent gains across expert-judged dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and safety, while reducing the hallucination rate by 72\%. A two-week online A/B test demonstrates a 28.6\% increase in like rate, a 46.2\% decrease in dislike rate, and a 92.7\% reduction in URL hallucination. The system has been running in production for over half a year and has served millions of QA interactions.

TL;DR: dLLM is an open-source framework unifying core components of diffusion language modeling (training, inference, evaluation) to address reproducibility and customization challenges in DLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of standardization and transparency in diffusion language model components scattered across ad-hoc codebases, hindering reproducibility and extension.

Method: Introduces dLLM, a framework standardizing DLM components (training, inference, evaluation) while enabling customization for new methods. Supports reproduction, finetuning, deployment, and evaluation of existing models like LLaDA and Dream, and offers recipes for building small DLMs from scratch.

Result: Provides reproducible pipelines for DLMs, checkpoints for small DLMs, and tools to convert BERT-style encoders or autoregressive LMs into DLMs.

Conclusion: dLLM democratizes DLM research by making components accessible, standardized, and flexible, accelerating innovation in the field.

Abstract: Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.
  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing persuasive dialogue agents rely on limited predefined strategies, missing the complexity of real-world interactions.

Method: Developed a framework integrating strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory, validated on two datasets.

Result: Achieved strong performance and improved persuasion success rates, especially for individuals with initially low intent.

Conclusion: The framework enhances persuasiveness and generalizability, addressing a key challenge in persuasive dialogue agents.

Abstract: Current approaches to developing persuasive dialogue agents often rely on a limited set of predefined persuasive strategies that fail to capture the complexity of real-world interactions. We applied a cross-disciplinary approach to develop a framework for designing persuasive dialogue agents that draws on proven strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory. We validated our proposed framework through experiments on two distinct datasets: the Persuasion for Good dataset, which represents a specific in-domain scenario, and the DailyPersuasion dataset, which encompasses a wide range of scenarios. The proposed framework achieved strong results for both datasets and demonstrated notable improvement in the persuasion success rate as well as promising generalizability. Notably, the proposed framework also excelled at persuading individuals with initially low intent, which addresses a critical challenge for persuasive dialogue agents.

TL;DR: InteractCS-RL is a framework that uses multi-granularity reinforcement learning to balance empathetic communication and budget-aware decision-making in task-oriented dialogues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in balancing empathetic communication with cost-effective decision-making in task-oriented dialogues, which existing methods fail to address adequately.

Method: Proposes InteractCS-RL, featuring a User-centric Interaction Framework for high-fidelity training and Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy and PID-Lagrangian cost controller.

Result: InteractCS-RL significantly outperforms baselines in real business scenarios and shows robustness across diverse domains in further evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances user rewards and cost constraints, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability in task-oriented dialogues.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the transition from conversational chatbots to general agents. However, effectively balancing empathetic communication with budget-aware decision-making remains an open challenge. Since existing methods fail to capture these complex strategic trade-offs, we propose InteractCS-RL, a framework that reframes task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning process. Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints. Extensive experiments on customized real business scenarios demonstrate that InteractCS-RL significantly outperform other baselines across three evaluation dimensions. Further evaluation on tool-agent-user interaction benchmarks verify InteractCS-RL robustness across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KGT introduces dedicated entity tokens and a relation-guided gating mechanism to bridge the granularity mismatch between LLMs and KGs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the granularity mismatch between token-based LLMs and entity-based KGs, improving knowledge graph completion.

Method: Specialized tokenization, fusion of pre-trained features via relation-guided gating, and decoupled prediction using independent heads.

Result: KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: KGT effectively integrates textual and structural features for superior knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is promising but hindered by a fundamental granularity mismatch. LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares annotator-specific models and label distribution models for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), finding the latter more stable due to the task's cognitive complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the variability in human judgments in NLP tasks, particularly in IDRR, where disagreement stems from cognitive complexity.

Method: The authors compare perspectivist models (predicting individual annotator interpretations) with models trained on label distributions.

Result: Annotator-specific models perform poorly unless ambiguity is reduced, while distribution-trained models yield stable predictions.

Conclusion: Cognitive complexity drives inconsistency in IDRR, making perspectivist modeling challenging and favoring distribution-based approaches.

Abstract: There is growing recognition that many NLP tasks lack a single ground truth, as human judgments reflect diverse perspectives. To capture this variation, models have been developed to predict full annotation distributions rather than majority labels, while perspectivist models aim to reproduce the interpretations of individual annotators. In this work, we compare these approaches on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), a highly ambiguous task where disagreement often arises from cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias. Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Czech dataset in the restaurant domain for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), enriched with annotations of opinion terms. The dataset supports three distinct ABSA tasks involving opinion terms, accommodating varying levels of complexity. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments using modern Transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings. To address cross-lingual challenges, we propose a translation and label alignment methodology leveraging LLMs, which yields consistent improvements. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art models, especially when handling the linguistic intricacies of low-resource languages like Czech. A detailed error analysis reveals key challenges, including the detection of subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiment expressions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' ability to simulate social media user behavior using Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), highlighting issues with form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings and questioning the need for explicit conditioning under fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the operational validity of LLMs transitioning from tools to active participants in social science, specifically in simulating social media user behavior.

Method: Introduced Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP) to compare LLM-generated outputs with authentic digital traces. Evaluated 8B models across languages, prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit), and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Result: SFT aligns text structure but degrades semantic grounding in low-resource settings. Explicit conditioning becomes redundant under fine-tuning as models infer directly from behavioral histories.

Conclusion: Challenges 'naive prompting' paradigms and suggests prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for accurate simulation.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from exploratory tools to active "silicon subjects" in social science lacks extensive validation of operational validity. This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current "naive prompting" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting hidden, concerning behaviors in language models that evade direct questioning, enabling better alignment auditing.

Method: AuditBench uses 56 models with 14 implanted behaviors. An investigator agent autonomously tests auditing tools, evaluating their efficacy through varied training techniques.

Result: Results show a tool-to-agent gap, scaffolded prompts improve auditing, and black-box tools outperform white-box ones. Auditing difficulty depends on training methods.

Conclusion: AuditBench provides a framework for iterative alignment auditing research, highlighting effective tools and training impacts.

Abstract: We introduce AuditBench, an alignment auditing benchmark. AuditBench consists of 56 language models with implanted hidden behaviors. Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing.

### [142] [Towards Better RL Training Data Utilization via Second-Order Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22765)
*Zhe Yang,Yudong Wang,Rang Li,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces second-order rollout and a unified framework for joint training of generation and critique capabilities in RL-enhanced LLMs, showing improved performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs focus on generation capability but neglect critique training, limiting data potential.

Method: Proposes second-order rollout (critique generation) and a framework combining generation and critique training.

Result: Outperforms vanilla RL in performance and data efficiency, with insights on critique training challenges.

Conclusion: Demonstrates benefits of joint training and dynamic data augmentation, inspiring further RL advancements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, but vanilla RL mainly focuses on generation capability improvement by training with only first-order rollout (generating multiple responses for a question), and we argue that this approach fails to fully exploit the potential of training data because of the neglect of critique capability training. To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training

### [143] [Imagination Helps Visual Reasoning, But Not Yet in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22766)
*You Li,Chi Chen,Yanghao Li,Fanhu Zeng,Kaiyu Huang,Jinan Xu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates latent visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using Causal Mediation Analysis, uncovering disconnections in input-latent and latent-answer chains, and proposes a simpler alternative, CapImagine, which outperforms latent-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the effectiveness of latent visual reasoning in MLLMs and determine if latent tokens truly drive reasoning, as their role remains unclear.

Method: Uses Causal Mediation Analysis to model the process as a causal chain (input as treatment, latent tokens as mediator, output as outcome) and probes the relationships between input, latent tokens, and final answers.

Result: Reveals two disconnections: input-latent (latent tokens don't effectively attend to input) and latent-answer (latent tokens minimally impact output). Latent tokens also encode limited visual information and are highly similar.

Conclusion: Challenges the necessity of latent reasoning, proposing CapImagine, a text-based explicit imagination method, which outperforms latent-space baselines on vision benchmarks.

Abstract: Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.

### [144] [Probing for Knowledge Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22787)
*Ivo Brink,Alexander Boer,Dennis Ulmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A probe trained on hidden model representations can reliably predict the dominant knowledge source (context or internal weights) behind LLM outputs, using self-supervised data from AttriWiki. It achieves high accuracy (0.96 Macro-F1) and transfers well to out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLM hallucinations by identifying whether outputs are based on prompt context or internal knowledge (contributive attribution).

Method: Use a linear classifier (probe) trained on model hidden representations with labeled data from AttriWiki, a self-supervised pipeline that generates examples by prompting models to recall or read entities.

Result: Probes achieve up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on models like Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, with strong out-of-domain transfer (0.94-0.99 Macro-F1). Attribution mismatches increase error rates by up to 70%.

Conclusion: While contributive attribution is effective in linking knowledge source confusion to unfaithful answers, broader detection frameworks are needed as models may still err even with correct attribution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.

### [145] [Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P): A Modular Governance Method for Prompt Design Under Model Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22790)
*Hyunwoo Kim,Hanau Yi,Jaehee Bae,Yumin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses GPT-scale model drift by proposing Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a modular governance method for stable LLM control, accessible to non-developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of ensuring stable and interpretable control over evolving LLMs due to shifts in policies and alignment regimes.

Method: NLD-P formalizes declarative governance, separating provenance, logic, content, and evaluation in natural language without external code.

Result: NLD-P serves as a governance framework for non-developers, with compliance criteria and schema receptivity analyzed.

Conclusion: NLD-P offers declarative control for evolving LLMs, with future work needed for empirical validation.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.

*Reihaneh Iranmanesh,Saeedeh Davoudi,Pasha Abrishamchian,Ophir Frieder,Nazli Goharian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Persian-specific evaluation framework for LLMs, addressing shortcomings of existing methods and improving scoring consistency by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Persian cultural benchmarks lack depth due to reliance on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics, failing to account for Persian's linguistic complexities.

Method: The framework uses rule-based morphological normalization and a hybrid syntactic-semantic similarity module for soft-match scoring.

Result: Testing 15 LLMs showed a 10% improvement in scoring consistency compared to exact-match baselines, capturing nuanced meaning.

Conclusion: The publicly released framework sets a standardized benchmark for Persian cultural understanding and aids cross-cultural LLM research.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.

*Jianmin Li,Ying Chang,Su-Kit Tang,Yujia Liu,Yanwen Wang,Shuyuan Lin,Binkai Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TCM-DiffRAG, a RAG framework integrating knowledge graphs and Chain of Thought, improves LLM performance in TCM by enhancing accuracy and alignment between general and clinical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods perform poorly in TCM due to complex reasoning and individual differences. This study aims to create a tailored RAG framework for TCM.

Method: Developed TCM-DiffRAG, combining knowledge graphs and Chain of Thought, and tested it on TCM datasets.

Result: TCM-DiffRAG significantly improved LLM performance over native models, SFT LLMs, and other RAG methods, especially for non-Chinese LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating structured knowledge with reasoning enhances TCM diagnostic tasks, showing promise for LLM applications in the field.

Abstract: Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.

### [148] [Improving Neural Argumentative Stance Classification in Controversial Topics with Emotion-Lexicon Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22846)
*Mohammad Yeghaneh Abkenar,Weixing Wang,Manfred Stede,Davide Picca,Mark A. Finlayson,Panagiotis Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve stance classification in argumentation mining by expanding an emotion lexicon (NRC) using DistilBERT embeddings, enhancing performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Argumentation mining often neglects fine-grained emotion analysis, and prior stance classification work lacks generalizability due to domain-specific limitations.

Method: The authors expand the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon with DistilBERT embeddings and integrate it into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model.

Result: The expanded lexicon (eNRC) outperforms baselines, original NRC, and LLM-based approaches across five datasets, achieving F1 score improvements up to 6.2 percentage points.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances stance classification by leveraging contextualized emotion analysis, with resources made available for future research.

Abstract: Argumentation mining comprises several subtasks, among which stance classification focuses on identifying the standpoint expressed in an argumentative text toward a specific target topic. While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.

*Jonathan Davidov,Aviv Slobodkin,Shmuel Tomi Klein,Reut Tsarfaty,Ido Dagan,Ayal Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-linguistic projection method using QA-SRL to extend semantic annotation beyond English, achieving high-quality results in Hebrew, Russian, and French.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic annotation is costly and largely limited to English; the goal is to make predicate-argument parsing accessible across languages.

Method: Uses QA-SRL framework with constrained translation and word-alignment to generate annotations automatically.

Result: Produces high-quality training data and parsers outperforming multilingual LLM baselines like GPT-4o and LLaMA-Maverick.

Conclusion: QA-SRL enables efficient and broad predicate-argument parsing across diverse languages.

Abstract: Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.

*Yushi Ye,Feng Hong,Huangjie Zheng,Xu Chen,Zhiyong Chen,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReMix integrates continuous representations into discrete diffusion decoding to resolve combinatorial contradictions, achieving faster inference without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) suffer from a quality-speed trade-off due to combinatorial contradictions in parallel decoding.

Method: Proposes ReMix with a Continuous Mixing State for iterative refinement in continuous space and a rejection rule for stability.

Result: Achieves a 2-8× inference speedup with no quality degradation.

Conclusion: ReMix effectively mitigates combinatorial contradictions, enhancing DLLM performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) promise fast non-autoregressive inference but suffer a severe quality-speed trade-off in parallel decoding. This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.

*Roy Miles,Aysim Toker,Andreea-Maria Oncescu,Songcen Xu,Jiankang Deng,Ismail Elezi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, which leverages diffusion-sampled reasoning trajectories and step-level stitching to improve answer accuracy and reduce latency in math and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aggregation strategies discard useful intermediate reasoning steps, limiting their potential. The goal is to reuse step-level candidates from diverse reasoning trajectories for better results.

Method: 1) Sample diverse reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion model. 2) Score intermediate steps with a process reward model (PRM). 3) Stitch high-quality steps into a composite rationale, which conditions an autoregressive solver to compute the final answer.

Result: The framework improves accuracy by up to 23.8% across six tasks and reduces latency by up to 1.8x compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Step-level recombination is particularly effective for harder problems, and the autoregressive solver plays a critical role in converting imperfect rationales into accurate answers.

Abstract: Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e.g., selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or "nearly correct" attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. At the same time, it achieves up to a 1.8x latency reduction relative to both traditional diffusion models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified architectures (e.g., TiDAR).

*Jonathan Steinberg,Oren Gal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how OCR information flows in three VLM architectures, revealing architecture-dependent bottlenecks and shared text-processing pathways. OCR removal can enhance counting performance in modular models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover where OCR information integrates into VLMs' language processing streams and how architecture differences affect this integration.

Method: Causal interventions are used by comparing activations between original and text-inpainted images across Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, and InternVL3.5 models.

Result: OCR bottlenecks vary by architecture: DeepStack models peak mid-depth, while projection models peak early. PCA shows low-dimensional OCR signals, and modular OCR circuits can interfere with visual tasks.

Conclusion: OCR routing depends on architecture, with shared pathways across datasets. Modular OCR circuits may hinder visual tasks, suggesting trade-offs in VLM design.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can read text from images, but where does this optical character recognition (OCR) information enter the language processing stream? We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Affine-Scaled Attention introduces input-dependent scaling and bias to softmax-normalized attention, improving flexibility and stability in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax normalization limits attention flexibility and stability; prior solutions offer only partial control.

Method: Propose Affine-Scaled Attention with scaling and bias terms to adjust attention distribution and magnitude.

Result: Improves training stability, optimization, and downstream task performance in language models.

Conclusion: Modest attention reweighting enhances Transformer behavior effectively.

Abstract: Transformer attention is typically implemented using softmax normalization, which enforces attention weights with unit sum normalization. While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.
  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.

*Gabriela Anna Kaczmarek,Pietro Ferrazzi,Lorenzo Porta,Vicky Rubini,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for automatic CRF-filling from Italian clinical notes using LLMs, highlights data scarcity issues, and reports pilot results showing zero-shot potential but biases needing correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of annotated CRF data for training and testing LLMs in clinical settings, particularly for Italian Emergency Department notes.

Method: Created a dataset of Italian clinical notes annotated with a predefined CRF (134 items), analyzed the data, defined evaluation metrics, and conducted pilot experiments with an open-source LLM.

Result: Zero-shot CRF-filling is feasible but biased (e.g., favoring 'unknown' answers), requiring corrections for better performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for CRF-filling in Italian clinical contexts, though bias mitigation is essential for reliable automation.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

*Yuqi Shi,Hao Yang,Xiyao Lu,Jinsong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Non-linear acquisition of prosodic boundaries in L2 learners leads to distorted prosodic hierarchy despite boundary quantity convergence at high proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface, particularly how learners map syntactic word order onto prosodic structures.

Method: Compare 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. Apply C-ToBI boundary annotation and Dependency Grammar analysis to examine prosodic boundaries and their syntactic relations.

Result: High-proficiency learners (VNH) match native baseline in boundary quantity at Major Phrase level (B3) but diverge in structural mapping, altering prosodic hierarchy.

Conclusion: Learners maintain high long phrasal output at the cost of structural accuracy, resulting in an inverted native prosodic pattern.

Abstract: While second language (L2) learners may acquire target syntactic word order, mapping this syntax onto appropriate prosodic structures remains a persistent challenge. This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.

The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALA, an LLM agent combining stylometry and LLM reasoning for authorship attribution and privacy protection in news articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about deanonymization risks in textual data motivate the need for interpretable methods to evaluate and mitigate such risks.

Method: Proposes SALA, integrating stylometric features with LLM reasoning, and includes a database module and guided recomposition strategy.

Result: Experiments show SALA achieves high accuracy in authorship attribution and reduces identifiability while preserving text meaning.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the deanonymization potential of LLMs and the need for proactive, interpretable defenses to protect author privacy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

### [158] [Modality Collapse as Mismatched Decoding: Information-Theoretic Limits of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23136)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs struggle to utilize speaker voice or object texture despite preserving modality-specific information, due to decoder limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why multimodal LLMs fail to leverage speaker and visual attributes despite their presence in encoded data.

Method: Analyze linear probes, decoder loss, and introduce Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) to bound accessible information. Validate across models and conduct controlled experiments.

Result: Decoder’s text-aligned scoring rule limits information extraction; training objectives can unlock specific attributes (e.g., emotion).

Conclusion: Decoder design, not encoding, restricts multimodal LLM performance; targeted training can improve accessibility.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.
  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning. Our benchmark, construction code, and baseline models are available at https://github.com/pshlego/SPARTA/tree/main.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., "at the game today!" is a more likely caption than "a photo of 37 people standing behind a field". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously address allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behavior in crowdsourcing platforms.

Method: FORGE, a physics-grounded multi-agent simulator, and a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that combines a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior.

Result: The proposed method achieves the highest reward with only 7.6% workforce utilization, maintaining robustness to workforce turnover and observation noise.

Conclusion: The approach successfully resolves the four-way tension in crowdsourcing platforms, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behaviour--a dilemma we formalise as the Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, and Strategic Agency Dilemma. Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\text{LRew} = 0.555 \pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $σ= 0.20$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphones pose unique challenges for agentic systems due to constrained execution, fragmented interfaces, and dynamic app states. Existing LLM frameworks need adaptation for reliable mobile autonomy.

Method: ClawMobile employs a hierarchical architecture, separating high-level language reasoning from deterministic control pathways to enhance stability and reproducibility.

Result: The approach improves execution reliability on real devices and identifies key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability for mobile LLM runtimes.

Conclusion: Robust smartphone-native agents require coordinated probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces. ClawMobile's open-sourced implementation encourages further exploration.

Abstract: Smartphones represent a uniquely challenging environment for agentic systems. Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires rethinking how reasoning and control are composed.
  We introduce ClawMobile as a concrete exploration of this design space. ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways, improving execution stability and reproducibility on real devices. Using ClawMobile as a case study, we distill the design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. We argue that building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces. The implementation is open-sourced~\footnote{https://github.com/ClawMobile/ClawMobile} to facilitate future exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from perceptual fragility due to limited training datasets, restricting their robustness.

Method: Introduces AOT-SFT, a large-scale adversarial dataset, and AOT, a self-play framework involving an Attacker generating image manipulations and a Defender MLLM adapting to these challenges.

Result: AOT significantly improves the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: The AOT framework provides a scalable solution for training more reliable MLLMs by leveraging adversarial self-play.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

Motivation: Address the gap in recognizing stroke symptoms early to reduce care-seeking delays.

Method: Developed a symptom taxonomy using patient language and a dual ML pipeline (GNN and EN/LASSO) to identify stroke-risk patterns, integrated into a hybrid screening system evaluated via EHR simulations.

Result: High specificity (1.00) and PPV (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), particularly effective in a 90-day window.

Conclusion: Patient-reported language enables high-precision, low-burden stroke risk detection, providing a critical window for clinical intervention.

Abstract: Stroke affected millions annually, yet poor symptom recognition often delayed care-seeking. To address risk recognition gap, we developed a passive surveillance system for early stroke risk detection using patient-reported symptoms among individuals with diabetes. Constructing a symptom taxonomy grounded in patients own language and a dual machine learning pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO), we identified symptom patterns associated with subsequent stroke. We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, that could offer a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions in energy systems is challenging, and traditional methods relying on single geospatial attributes are limited.

Method: The method uses a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to model high-resolution units as nodes, integrating diverse geographic features to generate weights for grid points, enhancing Voronoi-based allocation.

Result: Experiments show the method improves scalability, accuracy, physical plausibility, and precision over traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional spatial resolution coupling techniques in energy systems.

Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches are limited to single domains (molecules or materials) and single tasks (generation or prediction), hindering representation sharing and transfer.

Method: Zatom-1 employs a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective to jointly model discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries.

Result: Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines in generative and predictive tasks, reduces inference time significantly, and shows positive predictive transfer between domains.

Conclusion: Joint generative pretraining with Zatom-1 enables scalable, efficient, and versatile modeling for both molecules and materials, bridging gaps in current AI approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: CCA identifies causal direction by comparing the convergence speeds of neural networks trained in opposite causal directions, showing faster convergence aligns with causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for causal direction identification that leverages optimization dynamics rather than traditional statistical independence or distributional asymmetries.

Method: Train two neural networks (X→Y and Y→X) and infer causality based on which direction converges faster, supported by theoretical asymmetry under additive noise models.

Result: CCA correctly identifies causal direction in 26/30 cases on synthetic benchmarks, achieving perfect accuracy on sine and exponential processes.

Conclusion: CCA provides a novel, optimization-based approach to causal inference, integrated into CCL for broader applications like graph structure learning.

Abstract: We introduce Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA), a principle for causal direction identification based on optimization dynamics in which one neural network is trained to predict $Y$ from $X$ and another to predict $X$ from $Y$, and the direction that converges faster is inferred to be causal. Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon \perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum-inspired sequence modeling framework using complex-valued wave functions and learned Hamiltonians, leveraging quantum interference for disambiguation tasks with theoretical advantages over real-valued models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of standard recurrent architectures by utilizing quantum interference principles for more efficient disambiguation tasks.

Method: The method involves a unitary dynamics framework with a complex-valued wave function evolving under a learned Hamiltonian, using the Born rule for token probabilities.

Result: The results show a quadratic representational advantage for complex unitary models over real-valued ones in disambiguation tasks, with conserved pairwise currents for tracing information flow.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the theoretical and practical benefits of the quantum-inspired framework for sequence modeling, particularly its efficiency in handling phase correlations.

Abstract: We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.

TL;DR: ParamMem enhances language agents by introducing parametric memory for diverse reflection generation, improving task performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing repetitive outputs in self-reflection for language agents by increasing reflective diversity, which correlates with task success.

Method: Introduces ParamMem, a parametric memory module encoding cross-sample reflection patterns, and ParamAgent, integrating it with episodic and cross-sample memory.

Result: Shows consistent improvements in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop QA, with efficient sampling and weak-to-strong transfer.

Conclusion: ParamMem effectively enhances language agents by enabling diverse reflections and self-improvement without external models.

Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOCO, a perturbation-based non-BP method, leverages low-rank and orthogonality constraints for efficient deep spiking neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and scalability challenges of existing non-BP methods, inspired by brain dynamics.

Method: Proposes LOCO, combining low-rank property and orthogonality constraints to enhance gradient estimates and convergence.

Result: Achieves deep network training (10+ layers), better efficiency, continual learning, and O(1) parallel time complexity.

Conclusion: LOCO is a promising approach for high-performance, real-time, lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Recognizing the substantial computational cost of backpropagation (BP), non-BP methods have emerged as attractive alternatives for efficient learning on emerging neuromorphic systems. However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.

*Camilo Chacón Sartori,Guillem Rodríguez Corominas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-synthesized simulators (CWMs) effectively optimize stochastic combinatorial problems, outperforming baselines and achieving near-optimal results without relying on optimal policy trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether LLMs can learn and control optimizer behavior in stochastic combinatorial optimization by synthesizing simulators from suboptimal trajectories.

Method: Extend Code World Models (CWMs) to stochastic optimization, synthesize optimizer simulators from suboptimal trajectories, and use greedy planning to select mutation strengths.

Result: CWMs perform close to optimal (6% gap) on some problems, achieve 100% success on deceptive cases, outperform baselines on NK-Landscape, and exceed DQN in efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: CWMs demonstrate robust optimization control without optimal policy knowledge, showcasing potential for adaptive and efficient problem-solving in stochastic domains.

Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.

*Yuvarani,Akashdeep Singh,Zahra Fathanah,Salsabila Harlen,Syeikha Syafura Al-Zahra binti Zahari,Hema Subramaniam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A context-aware model switching system reduces energy consumption by up to 67.5% while maintaining response quality, improving efficiency in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unsustainable energy consumption of large language models by avoiding unnecessary use of large models for simpler tasks.

Method: Proposes a dynamic model switching approach using caching, rule-based scoring, ML classification, and user adaptation to select models based on query complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 67.5% energy savings and a 68% improvement in response time for simple queries, with 93.6% response quality retention.

Conclusion: Model switching offers a scalable and sustainable solution for energy-efficient AI without compromising quality.

Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

### [178] [Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22265)
*Chika Maduabuchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECFM is an entropy-controlled flow matching method that optimizes trajectories to prevent low-entropy bottlenecks, ensuring better semantic mode preservation and offering guarantees of mode coverage and density stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow-matching objectives lack direct control over the information geometry of trajectories, leading to transient loss of semantic modes. ECFM addresses this by enforcing a global entropy-rate budget.

Method: ECFM is a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths, formulated as a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system. It also has a stochastic-control representation akin to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier.

Result: ECFM achieves entropic OT geodesics in the pure transport regime and guarantees mode coverage and density stability. It also constructs counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Conclusion: ECFM provides a robust framework for entropy-controlled trajectory optimization, enhancing semantic mode preservation and offering theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Result: Validated on a test scenario with single parameter changes, showing accurate localization and updating of parameter variations.

Conclusion: The digital twin framework effectively detects and diagnoses faults in thermal-hydraulic processes, enhancing real-time supervision.

Abstract: The real-time supervision of production processes is a common challenge across several industries. It targets process component monitoring and its predictive maintenance in order to ensure safety, uninterrupted production and maintain high efficiency level. The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system. The numerical results show good accuracy in terms of parameter variation localization and the update of their values.

*Changhai Zhou,Shiyang Zhang,Yuhua Zhou,Qian Qiao,Jun Gao,Cheng Jin,Kaizhou Qin,Weizhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQRA jointly optimizes quantization bit-width and LoRA rank to improve downstream adaptation under memory constraints, achieving near full-precision performance with 4-bit memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential quantization and fine-tuning pipelines ignore the interplay between bit-width and LoRA rank, leading to suboptimal performance under memory limits.

Method: AutoQRA uses a two-stage approach: (1) global evolutionary search with layer-wise priors, and (2) local Bayesian optimization for refinement, compensating for quantization noise.

Result: AutoQRA matches full-precision fine-tuning performance while using memory comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of quantization and LoRA rank through AutoQRA enhances adaptation efficiency under memory constraints.

Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with weak epidemic signals, oversimplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation.

Method: STOEP combines Case-aware Adjacency Learning, Space-informed Parameter Estimating, and Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting.

Result: STOEP achieves a 11.1% improvement in RMSE on COVID-19 and influenza datasets and has been deployed in China.

Conclusion: STOEP effectively addresses limitations of current methods and enhances epidemic prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at one provincial CDC in China to facilitate downstream applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets causal self-attention transformers probabilistically, revealing structural constraints and a boundary where attention becomes unstable, akin to support vectors in SVMs. It proposes a Bayesian framework with a modified training objective for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical insights into self-attention transformers by reinterpreting them within a probabilistic framework, uncovering hidden structural constraints and improving model robustness.

Method: Reformulate causal self-attention transformers probabilistically, introduce a Bayesian framework, and modify the training objective with a smooth log-barrier penalty.

Result: The probabilistic re-interpretation reveals structural insights and a boundary condition for attention. The modified training yields robust models without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: The probabilistic framework and modified training objective enhance understanding and robustness of self-attention transformers, offering practical improvements.

Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.

TL;DR: PASTN is a lightweight model for traffic flow forecasting that uses positional-aware embeddings and temporal attention to improve node distinction and long-range perception, validated across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack clarity in node distinction and holistic historical views, and struggle with large-scale data deployment.

Method: PASTN employs positional-aware embeddings for node separation and a temporal attention module for long-range spatiotemporal modeling.

Result: PASTN shows effectiveness and efficiency across county, megalopolis, and state-scale datasets.

Conclusion: PASTN addresses prior limitations and proves scalable and effective for traffic flow forecasting.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting has emerged as an indispensable mission for daily life, which is required to utilize the spatiotemporal relationship between each location within a time period under a graph structure to predict future flow. However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of newly introduced modules either.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models in critical applications like channel estimation hinder their practical deployment in AI-native 6G architectures.

Method: X-REFINE uses a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule to backpropagate predictions, generating high-resolution relevance scores for subcarriers and hidden neurons for holistic optimization.

Result: Simulations show X-REFINE reduces computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across scenarios.

Conclusion: X-REFINE provides an effective solution for interpretable and efficient AI-native architectures in 6G wireless communications.

Abstract: AI-native architectures are vital for 6G wireless communications. The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models employed in critical applications, such as channel estimation, limit their practical deployment. While perturbation-based XAI solutions offer input filtering, they often neglect internal structural optimization. We propose X-REFINE, an XAI-based framework for joint input-filtering and architecture fine-tuning. By utilizing a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule, X-REFINE backpropagates predictions to derive high-resolution relevance scores for both subcarriers and hidden neurons. This enables a holistic optimization that identifies the most faithful model components. Simulation results demonstrate that X-REFINE achieves a superior interpretability-performance-complexity trade-off, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across different scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is a leading global cause of death, requiring advanced tools for early identification and risk classification.

Method: Used a dataset of 1,190 patient records to compare ML ensembles (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) with LLMs via OpenRouter APIs, testing zero-shot and few-shot approaches.

Result: ML ensembles outperformed LLMs alone (95.78% accuracy, 0.96 AUC vs. 78.9% accuracy), but hybrid ML-LLM fusion achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC).

Conclusion: Hybrid ML-LLM systems offer slight performance gains over ML ensembles alone, suggesting potential for more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD approaches are task-specific and focus on point clouds or images, not B-rep. BrepCoder addresses these limitations by unifying CAD tasks under a single model.

Method: BrepCoder converts CAD sequences into Python-like code aligned with B-rep. It uses a two-stage training: pre-training on reverse engineering, then extending to downstream tasks like completion and error correction.

Result: BrepCoder achieves superior generalization across tasks by interpreting B-rep as structural code, proving its potential as a general-purpose CAD agent.

Conclusion: BrepCoder demonstrates effectiveness as a unified model for diverse CAD tasks, leveraging LLMs and B-rep representation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have actively addressed complex challenges within the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) domain.However, most existing approaches rely on task-specifi c models requiring structural modifi cations for new tasks, and they predominantly focus on point clouds or images rather than the industry-standard Boundary Representation (B-rep) format. To address these limitations, we propose BrepCoder, a unifi ed Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs diverse CAD tasks from B-rep inputs. By leveraging the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we convert CAD modeling sequences into Python-like code and align them with B-rep. We then adopt a two-stage training strategy: First, pre-training on reverse engineering to learn geometric features and design logic. Second, eff ectively extending the model to various downstream tasks such as completion, error correction, and CAD-QA. Consequently, by interpreting B-rep as structural code, BrepCoder achieves superior generalization across diverse tasks, demonstrating its potential as a general-purpose CAD agent.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework was developed to predict high dosing error rates in clinical trials using pre-trial data, achieving strong performance with interpretable risk stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early identification of clinical trials at risk of high dosing errors using pre-initiation data for proactive quality management.

Method: Dataset from 42,112 CTs was used, combining structured and unstructured data. XGBoost, ClinicalModernBERT, and a late-fusion model were evaluated, with post-hoc probability calibration.

Result: Late-fusion model achieved highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Calibrated outputs enabled effective risk categorization, aligning with actual error rates.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, reproducible solution for early risk stratification of dosing errors in clinical trials.

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.

TL;DR: OmniZip is a unified, lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data, outperforming existing methods and achieving high compression efficiency across diverse data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based lossless compressors are often limited to single modalities, causing inefficiency in multi-modal settings. A unified solution is needed.

Method: OmniZip uses a modality-unified tokenizer, modality-routing context learning, and modality-routing feedforward design, enhanced by reparameterization training.

Result: OmniZip achieves 42% to 62% higher compression efficiency than gzip across multiple datasets and supports real-time inference on edge devices.

Conclusion: OmniZip provides an efficient, lightweight solution for multi-modal lossless compression, bridging gaps in current compressor designs.

Abstract: Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \textbf{OmniZip}, \textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\%, 57\%, 62\% and 42\%, 53\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively. It also supports near real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices, reaching about 1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A logic-based explainability method improves SCD prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy, ensuring transparency and correctness, outperforming heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting SCD in CC is challenging, especially for non-high-risk patients, and existing AI models lack transparency, hindering adoption.

Method: A logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees is applied to an AI classifier with high accuracy and recall.

Result: The method achieved strong predictive performance, 100% explanation fidelity, and superior consistency compared to heuristic methods.

Conclusion: This approach boosts clinical trust and facilitates AI tool integration, particularly in endemic regions.

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for mapping failure regions (Manifold of Failure) in LLMs using MAP-Elites, revealing distinct vulnerability patterns across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on restoring safety by projecting adversarial examples onto natural data; this paper aims to characterize unsafe regions for better AI safety understanding.

Method: The framework reframes vulnerability search as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites and Alignment Deviation as a metric to map failure regions (behavioral attraction basins).

Result: MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals model-specific topological signatures (e.g., Llama-3-8B shows universal vulnerability, GPT-5-Mini is robust).

Conclusion: The approach shifts the paradigm from discrete failure discovery to understanding the underlying structure of vulnerabilities, providing interpretable global safety maps.

Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

TL;DR: GraphRiverCast (GRC) is a topology-informed AI model for systemic river hydrodynamic simulation, capable of operating without historical data ('ColdStart') and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in hydrology and achieve systemic river simulation, enabling accurate predictions without reliance on historical observations.

Method: GRC uses topological encoding and physics-aligned neural operators for multivariate river hydrodynamics simulation, including a 'ColdStart' mode without historical data initialization.

Result: GRC achieves a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of ~0.82 in 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, outperforming physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines.

Conclusion: GRC demonstrates the importance of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training for accurate and adaptive river hydrodynamic simulation, bridging global knowledge with local reality.

Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.

*Timothy Oladunni,Blessing Ojeme,Kyndal Maclin,Clyde Baidoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PECT, an energy-based framework to stabilize deep learning models handling dynamic physiologic signals, ensuring predictions remain stable despite harmless signal fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models often misinterpret benign signal changes (amplitude, rate, morphology) as concept drift, leading to unstable predictions, especially in multimodal settings.

Method: Proposes PECT and its implementation, ECRL, a regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without altering encoder architectures or adding inference cost.

Result: Applied to ECG models, PECT preserved clean accuracy (96.0% to 94.1%), improved perturbed accuracy (72.6% to 85.5%), and reduced representation drift by over 45%.

Conclusion: PECT acts as an energy-drift law, ensuring concept stability in dynamic physiologic signals across various architectures.

Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.

*Dhiraj Neupane,Richard Dazeley,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for machinery fault detection (MFD), eliminating manual reward engineering and fault labels. It uses adversarial IRL to learn rewards from healthy sequences, enabling early fault detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based MFD methods fail to leverage sequential decision-making, often treating it as a simple guessing game. This work aims to align RL's strengths with MFD's temporal nature.

Method: Formulates MFD as an offline IRL problem, using adversarial IRL to train a discriminator that distinguishes normal (expert) transitions from policy-generated ones, generating anomaly scores.

Result: The framework assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, validated on three benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, XJTU-SY).

Conclusion: The work demonstrates effective RL-based diagnostics by aligning sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, suitable for data-driven industrial settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AviaSafe, a physics-informed AI model, forecasts cloud hydrometeor species globally for up to 7 days, addressing challenges like sparsity and microphysical interactions, outperforming baselines and enabling aviation safety applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI weather models lack the capability to predict cloud microphysical species, which are critical for aviation safety.

Method: AviaSafe uses a hierarchical, physics-informed neural network with masked attention for cloud distribution prediction and integrates the Icing Condition index. It trains on ERA5 reanalysis data.

Result: The model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species than baselines and outperforms operational models in some variables at 7-day lead times.

Conclusion: AviaSafe enables precise cloud species forecasting, improving aviation route optimization by identifying engine icing risks.

Abstract: Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk.

*Bruce W. Lee,Chen Yueh-Han,Tomek Korbak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-incrimination training trains AI agents to signal when behaving deceptively, reducing undetected harmful actions without compromising general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential hidden goals and deception by frontier AI agents, as alignment training may fail to prevent misbehavior.

Method: Agents are trained to call a report_scheming() tool when covertly misbehaving, tested in out-of-distribution environments.

Result: Self-incrimination significantly lowers undetected attack rates, outperforming monitors and alignment baselines, with consistent performance across tasks.

Conclusion: Self-incrimination training is a viable method to mitigate frontier AI misalignment risks without reliance on external detection.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.

*Yuda Bi,Wenjun Xiao,Linhao Bai,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the limitations of kurtosis-based ICA in wide, balanced mixtures, introducing a sharp redundancy law and proposing purification to restore contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the weakening performance of kurtosis-based ICA in wide, balanced mixtures, highlighting the need for improved methods.

Method: The authors prove a redundancy law for standardized projections and introduce purification, a technique to select sign-consistent sources, to restore contrast.

Result: Theoretical predictions show decay rates, crossover scales, and contrast recovery, validated through synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: Purification effectively restores contrast in ICA for wide mixtures, offering a practical solution beyond theoretical limitations.

Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|κ(y)|=O(κ_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_bκ_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim κ_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $Ω(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the opacity, fragility, and high computational demands of scaled-up deep learning models.

Method: Analyzing eigenvalue dynamics of activations, introducing EigenTrack for real-time reliability monitoring and RMT-KD for network compression.

Result: EigenTrack enables early detection of failures, and RMT-KD produces compact, efficient models without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral statistics offer a stable, interpretable approach to improving reliability and efficiency in deep learning.

Abstract: This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.

TL;DR: A shape-informed surrogate model is proposed for ECG simulations, combining high accuracy, low data needs, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG models face challenges in anatomical fidelity, data requirements, and computational cost, especially in clinical and high-density recording settings.

Method: The framework includes a geometry-encoding module for low-dimensional latent space mapping and a neural surrogate to predict lead-field gradients from anatomical shapes, coordinates, and electrode positions.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy (mean angular error 5°, relative mean squared error <2.5%) and outperforms existing approximations while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-fidelity ECG simulations in data-limited settings without requiring full torso segmentation, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (model) to extract target-specific signals from high-dimensional data, suppressing background variation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dominant shared variation in high-dimensional data masks biological signals, and existing methods are either not scalable or lack interpretability.

Method: The proposed model jointly factorizes target and background datasets using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective to suppress background-expressed structure.

Result: The approach efficiently extracts interpretable, target-specific signals and performs well on diverse biological datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively isolates biological signals obscured by background variation, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial Resistance, especially MDR, challenges clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and slow testing.

Method: Five ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) trained on 9,714 isolates; evaluated via accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, MCC. LIME used for interpretability.

Result: Ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM) outperformed others. LIME highlighted key antibiotics contributing to MDR predictions, aligning with biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: Combining accurate ML models with interpretability aids antimicrobial stewardship by enabling earlier MDR identification and trusted clinical decisions.

Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolFM-Lite is a multi-modal model integrating 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular representations via cross-attention and FiLM, showing improved AUC over single-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models often use a single molecular representation and treat geometry as static. MolFM-Lite addresses this by combining multiple modalities to capture richer molecular information.

Method: Uses SELFIES sequences (1D), graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) with cross-attention fusion and FiLM. Introduces conformer ensemble attention and cross-modal fusion for complementary information sharing.

Result: Tri-modal fusion improves AUC by 7-11% over single-modality baselines; conformer ensembles add ~2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K enables effective initialization.

Conclusion: MolFM-Lite demonstrates the value of multi-modal fusion and dynamic geometry handling for molecular property prediction, with reproducible code and models provided.

Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.

*Ruiqi Zhou,Donghao Zhu,Houcai Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based Hybrid framework adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching in dynamic markets like kidney/freight exchanges, reducing waiting times and congestion with minimal efficiency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed matching policies struggle with inflexibility in dynamic environments, where delayed matching improves efficiency but risks longer waits and congestion.

Method: The framework collects data on user departures, estimates departure distributions via regression, and uses a decision threshold to choose between immediate or delayed matching.

Result: The Hybrid framework reduces waiting times and congestion while maintaining high matching efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment between greedy and patient policies offers a robust, adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.

Abstract: In matching markets such as kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching has been shown to improve overall market efficiency. The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper examines whether smooth-basis models like Chebyshev polynomial regressors and RBF networks can compete with tree ensembles in tabular regression, benchmarking them across 55 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of smooth-basis models in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate, due to their suitability for gradual response variations and applications like surrogate optimisation.

Method: Developed anisotropic RBF networks, ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressors, and smooth-tree hybrids (Chebyshev model trees), benchmarking them against tree ensembles, transformers, and baselines.

Result: Transformers were most accurate but limited by GPU dependence. Smooth models and tree ensembles performed similarly on accuracy, but smooth models showed tighter generalisation gaps.

Conclusion: Smooth-basis models should be routinely considered, especially for applications benefiting from gradual predictions and tighter generalisation.

Abstract: Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.
  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.
  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing test-time guidance methods for diffusion models, revealing they fail to sample from the true Bayesian posterior. It proposes corrected estimators for calibrated sampling, showing superior performance in Bayesian tasks and matching top results in black hole image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time guidance methods focus on reward maximization, leading to miscalibrated inference. The paper aims to address this by ensuring proper sampling from the Bayesian posterior.

Method: Identifies flaws in current guidance methods and introduces consistent alternative estimators for calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior.

Result: The proposed methods outperform previous approaches in Bayesian inference tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results in black hole image reconstruction.

Conclusion: Correcting the structural approximations in test-time guidance enables accurate Bayesian posterior sampling, improving performance in inference tasks.

Abstract: Test-time guidance is a widely used mechanism for steering pretrained diffusion models toward outcomes specified by a reward function. Existing approaches, however, focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. In this work, we show that common test-time guidance methods do not recover the correct posterior distribution and identify the structural approximations responsible for this failure. We then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior. We significantly outperform previous methods on a set of Bayesian inference tasks, and match state-of-the-art in black hole image reconstruction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-PaperRec, an MLP with fairness regularization, boosts underrepresented-group inclusion (+42.03%) in paper selection while maintaining utility (~3.16% change), validated via synthetic and real-world conference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systemic biases in double-blind reviews disadvantaging underrepresented author groups by leveraging fairness regularization.

Method: Develop Fair-PaperRec, an MLP with differentiable fairness loss for intersectional attributes, tested on synthetic datasets and real ACM SIGCHI/DIS/IUI conference data.

Result: Achieves up to 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with ≤3.16% utility change, demonstrating fairness regularization's dual role in equity and quality.

Conclusion: Fair-PaperRec provides an equity-focused, practical framework for post-review selection, balancing inclusion and scholarly quality.

Abstract: Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.

Abstract: Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.

Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.

Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

Abstract: Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.

Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate LUMOS across 13 diverse SciML workloads, including cosmology and molecular sciences, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. Experiments on 13 SciML models show that LUMOS achieves 71.45% parameter reduction and a 6.4x inference speedup on average. Furthermore, Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on up to eight GPUs confirms the scalability of

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model.

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.

Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.

Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.

Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.

Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.

Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling. Code is available at https://github.com/galilai-group/llm-jepa#stp.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

Abstract: Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges. These features exhibit anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, and non-stationarity, creating bottlenecks for models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and requiring laborious manual feature engineering. We introduce KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture integrating a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. The KAN front-end uses learnable activation functions to automatically model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, while the gMLP backbone captures high-order interactions. Experiments on public benchmarks and an industrial dataset with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over baselines like GBDTs increasing at larger scales, validating KMLP as a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.

Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.

Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.

Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

Abstract: This study investigates a data-driven machine learning approach to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.

Abstract: We introduce Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO), a curvature aware training framework for neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds. The method replaces standard Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and improves stability via a Laplace Beltrami smoothness regularization term.
  Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.
  Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians. Applications include surface imaging, physics informed learning settings, and robotics on Lie groups such as SO(3) and SE(3). The framework unifies value and gradient based learning with curvature aware convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds.

Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.

Abstract: Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.

Abstract: The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but struggle to generalise beyond training distributions and are often constrained to a fixed temporal discretisation. This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $η^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(η)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(ηd^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{ηr T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.

Abstract: Generalization bounds for deep learning models are typically vacuous, not computable or restricted to specific model classes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by providing new disagreement-based certificates for the gap between the true risk of any two predictors. We then bound the true risk of the predictor of interest via a surrogate model that enjoys tight generalization guarantees, and evaluating our disagreement bound on an unlabeled dataset. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory. Importantly, such guarantees are achieved without modifying the target model, nor adapting the training procedure to the generalization framework.

Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.

Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.

Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.

Abstract: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.

Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.

Abstract: While Deep Learning has demonstrated impressive results in applications on various data types, it continues to lag behind tree-based methods when applied to tabular data, often referred to as the last "unconquered castle" for neural networks. We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.

Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.

Abstract: Generalization measures have been studied extensively in the machine learning community to better characterize generalization gaps. However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe. Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.

Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.

Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]

Abstract: Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.
  We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.
  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

Abstract: Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.
  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.

Conclusion: GYWI effectively enhances LLM-generated scientific ideas by integrating structured knowledge and hybrid retrieval, validated through comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' financial expertise and practical utility in business tasks.

Method: Curated financial exam questions and a systematic evaluation matrix with 3,000 scenario questions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, including XuanYuan 4.0, revealing their capabilities in finance.

Conclusion: FIRE provides insights into LLMs' financial application boundaries and releases resources for future research.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

*Willem Schooltink,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends causal abstractions to a framework called causal embeddings, enabling multiple detailed models to map into a coarser causal model, with applications in merging diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize causal abstractions into causal embeddings, allowing multiple detailed models to be embedded into a coarser causal model while preserving causal relations.

Method: Introduces causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, defines consistency, and formulates a multi-resolution marginal problem to showcase applications.

Result: Demonstrates the relevance of causal embeddings for statistical and causal marginal problems and practical use in merging datasets from models with different representations.

Conclusion: Causal embeddings provide a versatile framework for integrating multiple detailed models into a coarser causal structure, useful for merging heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

### [288] [Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)
*Varun Pratap Bhardwaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABC introduces formal behavioral contracts for AI agents, ensuring compliance and drift control through probabilistic satisfaction and recovery mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing drift and governance failures in AI agents by formalizing their behavior with contracts.

Method: Develops ABC contracts (Preconditions, Invariants, Governance, Recovery) and implements AgentAssert for runtime enforcement.

Result: Contracted agents detect more violations, ensure high compliance, and limit drift with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: ABC effectively brings formal behavioral control to AI agents, reducing failures and drift.

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

*Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents enable autonomous research workflows, introducing "vibe researching" and highlighting cognitive delegation boundaries. They excel in speed and coverage but lack theoretical originality. Implications for the profession include stratification risks and pedagogical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the transformative potential of AI agents in social science research, moving beyond isolated queries to executing entire pipelines autonomously.

Method: Introduces "vibe researching" and uses a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code as a case study. Develops a cognitive task framework to classify research activities by codifiability and tacit knowledge.

Result: Identifies AI agents' strengths (speed, coverage, methodological scaffolding) and weaknesses (theoretical originality, tacit field knowledge).

Conclusion: Highlights implications like augmentation fragility and stratification risk, proposing five principles for responsible "vibe researching."

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

### [290] [A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163)
*Usman Anwar,Julianna Piskorz,David D. Baek,David Africa,Jim Weatherall,Max Tegmark,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Mihaela van der Schaar,David Krueger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-theoretic approach to detect and quantify steganographic behaviors in large language models (LLMs), addressing gaps in classical methods by measuring usable information asymmetry via a 'steganographic gap.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack principled ways to detect steganography in LLMs, especially when a reference distribution of non-steganographic signals is unavailable. This poses risks for oversight.

Method: The authors propose a utilitarian framework called generalized $\mathcal{V}$-information to measure usable information asymmetry, defining the 'steganographic gap' to compare utility for agents with and without decoding capability.

Result: Empirical validation shows the framework effectively detects, quantifies, and mitigates steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: The decision-theoretic approach offers a practical solution to address steganography risks in LLMs, filling a critical gap in oversight mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

*Xinle Wu,Rui Zhang,Mustafa Anis Hussain,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: U-Mem introduces autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge, outperforming passive memory methods and RL-based optimization on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory agents are passive and reactive, limiting memory growth to available information without seeking external inputs during uncertainties.

Method: U-Mem uses a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade and semantic-aware Thompson sampling to actively acquire and validate knowledge.

Result: U-Mem improves performance significantly, surpassing benchmarks like HotpotQA (14.6 points) and AIME25 (7.33 points).

Conclusion: Autonomous memory agents like U-Mem enhance LLMs by actively managing knowledge, outperforming existing passive solutions.

Abstract: Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogARC, a human-adapted subset of ARC, to study cognitive strategies in abstract reasoning. Experiments with 260 participants revealed varied performance, divergent strategies for harder problems, and insights into generalization and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive strategies behind humans' flexible abstract reasoning and rapid rule-learning abilities.

Method: Administered CogARC to 260 participants, recording high-resolution behavioral data (viewing, edits, submissions) as they solved 75 abstract visual reasoning problems.

Result: Participants achieved high accuracy (~90% and ~80%) but varied widely. Harder problems led to longer deliberation and divergent strategies. Incorrect solutions often converged despite varied problem-solving trajectories.

Conclusion: CogARC provides a rich environment for studying human abstract reasoning, revealing insights into generalization, misgeneralization, and strategy adaptation under uncertainty.

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

*Jonas Karge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how agents with varying reliability can improve collective accuracy by learning to abstain from voting. It extends classical voting theory to include selective participation and validates findings via simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical voting theories like the Condorcet Jury Theorem assume fixed participation, but real-world scenarios benefit from allowing abstention. The study aims to generalize these theories to settings where agents can learn and abstain.

Method: A probabilistic framework is proposed where agents undergo a calibration phase to estimate their competence, followed by a confidence gate deciding whether to vote or abstain. Non-asymptotic bounds on group success probability are derived.

Result: The framework generalizes asymptotic guarantees of classical voting theories to sequential, confidence-gated settings. Empirical validation via Monte Carlo simulations supports the theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: Selective participation improves collective accuracy and has potential applications in AI safety, such as mitigating hallucinations in collective LLM decision-making.

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

TL;DR: ArchAgent, an AI-driven system, autonomously designs state-of-the-art cache replacement policies, achieving significant IPC speedup improvements faster than human-developed methods, while also uncovering simulator loopholes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for agile hardware design flows to meet increasing compute demands and the potential of agentic AI to advance algorithm design and architecture discovery.

Method: ArchAgent leverages AlphaEvolve to automatically design and implement cache replacement policies, including post-silicon hyperspecialization for workload-specific tuning.

Result: Achieved a 5.3% IPC speedup on Google Workload Traces and 0.9% on SPEC06, with a 2.4% improvement via hyperspecialization. Also discovered simulator loopholes.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can revolutionize computer architecture research, enabling faster, more efficient designs and uncovering overlooked system vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes latent reasoning methods, uncovering shortcut behaviors and insights into latent representation roles, revealing a trade-off between supervision strength and representation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms and behaviors of latent reasoning methods, which perform multi-step reasoning in continuous latent spaces, as their workings remain underexplored.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods across different supervision levels, identifying shortcut behaviors and testing hypotheses about latent space exploration.

Result: Findings include pervasive shortcuts in reasoning, limitations in structured search implementation, and a trade-off between supervision strength and latent representation diversity.

Conclusion: Stronger supervision reduces shortcuts but limits hypothesis diversity, while weaker supervision enriches latent representations at the expense of increased shortcuts.

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

*Gaoyuan Du,Amit Ahlawat,Xiaoyang Liu,Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Evaluation Agent (EA) for decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents, addressing gaps in evaluating intermediate decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AutoML evaluations focus on final outcomes, lacking structured metrics for assessing intermediate decision quality.

Method: Introduces an EA that evaluates decisions along four dimensions without interfering with execution.

Result: EA detects faulty decisions (F1=0.919), identifies reasoning inconsistencies, and quantifies downstream impacts.

Conclusion: Decision-centric evaluation reveals hidden failure modes, advancing reliable and interpretable autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Contrastive World Model (CWM) for action feasibility scoring outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by using contrastive learning with hard negatives, improving discrimination between valid and subtly wrong actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT approaches fail to discriminate effectively between physically correct and subtly wrong actions, limiting embodied agent performance.

Method: CWM fine-tunes an LLM with an InfoNCE contrastive objective, focusing on hard-negative examples to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space.

Result: CWM achieves higher Precision@1 (+6.76 points) and AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906) for minimal-edit negatives and maintains better safety margins under stress conditions.

Conclusion: Contrastive training with hard negatives captures physical feasibility more accurately than SFT, enhancing embodied agent pipelines.

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

*Joseph Tso,Preston Schmittou,Quan Huynh,Jibran Hutchins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConstraintBench evaluates LLMs' ability to solve constrained optimization problems directly without solver access, finding feasibility as the main challenge with only 65% constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can directly solve fully specified constrained optimization problems without relying on solvers, complementing existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduces ConstraintBench with 200 tasks across 10 domains, verified by Gurobi solver. Models must return structured solutions checked by a deterministic verifier.

Result: Best model achieves 65% constraint satisfaction but feasible solutions average 89-96% of Gurobi-optimal. Joint feasibility and optimality remains low (≤30.5%). Domain difficulty varies widely.

Conclusion: Feasibility is the primary bottleneck, with systematic failure modes identified. ConstraintBench will be publicly released.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of systematic understanding and tools for optimizing coding agents, which involve unique challenges like stochastic LLM completions and structured reasoning capture.

Method: VERO provides a reproducible evaluation harness (versioned snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, structured traces) and a benchmark suite for comparing optimizer configurations.

Result: An empirical study compares optimizer configurations, identifying modifications that reliably improve agent performance.

Conclusion: VERO supports future research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

Motivation: The rapid development of AI-LCA research lacks comprehensive synthesis, prompting this review to bridge the gap.

Method: The study combines LLM-based text mining with traditional literature review techniques to analyze trends and themes.

Result: AI adoption in LCA has grown significantly, with notable shifts toward LLM-driven approaches and ML applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates LLM-assisted methodologies' potential for reproducible reviews and efficient LCA, aiding practitioners in enhancing sustainability decisions.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces bipredictability (P) to measure shared information between observations, actions, and outcomes in AI systems, distinguishing agency from intelligence and proposing a feedback architecture for adaptive AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack principled measures to evaluate how effectively they interact with their environment, despite producing successful predictions.

Method: The study defines bipredictability (P), proves its bounds in different systems (quantum, classical, agents), and validates findings using a double pendulum, RL agents, and LLM conversations.

Result: P is bounded (unity in quantum systems, ≤0.5 in classical systems, lower with agency). Current AI achieves agency but not intelligence.

Conclusion: A feedback architecture inspired by thalamocortical regulation is proposed to monitor P, enabling adaptive and resilient AI.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

*Ryan Liu,Dilip Arumugam,Cedegao E. Zhang,Sean Escola,Xaq Pitkow,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using cognitive models and AI algorithms to design modular language agents by formalizing agent templates for LLM composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing complex tasks beyond single LLM capabilities by leveraging modular designs inspired by cognitive science and AI.

Method: Formalizing agent templates specifying LLM roles and compositions, surveying existing language agents for underlying templates.

Result: Identifies templates derived from cognitive models/AI algorithms as tools for interpretable, effective language agents.

Conclusion: Cognitive science and AI-inspired agent templates are valuable for developing advanced, interpretable modular language agents.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

### [303] [Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22539)
*Mohammad Hossein Shokouhi,Vincent W. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN, leveraging LLM-based agents to handle complex intents efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of coordinated agent frameworks for complex intents in autonomous RANs, particularly in O-RAN architectures.

Method: A multi-agent system with supervisor, user weighting, O-RU management, and monitoring agents, using DRL and PEFT for efficiency.

Result: The framework reduces active O-RUs by 41.93% in energy-saving mode and cuts memory usage by 92% with PEFT.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI framework effectively handles complex intents in O-RAN, improving scalability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

*Zhiming Wang,Jinwei He,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHCE enhances LLM agents' performance in specialized domains by dynamically integrating human expert feedback, achieving significant improvements in task success rates with minimal human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents lack long-tail knowledge for specialized domains, and unstructured human guidance is unreliable for direct integration.

Method: Introduces AHCE with a Human Feedback Module (HFM) that treats human experts as interactive reasoning tools for on-demand collaboration.

Result: Experiments in Minecraft show task success rate increases of 32% on normal difficulty and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks.

Conclusion: Effective augmentation of agents involves learning to request expert reasoning, not just simple help.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CourtGuard is a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework for LLM safety, using adversarial debate grounded in external policies. It outperforms static classifiers, offers zero-shot adaptability, and enables automated data curation and auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the rigidity of static classifiers in LLM safety, enabling adaptable enforcement of new governance rules without costly retraining.

Method: Introduces CourtGuard, a framework that orchestrates adversarial debates based on external policy documents for safety evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 benchmarks, generalizes to out-of-domain tasks (90% accuracy), and curates/audits 9 adversarial attack datasets.

Conclusion: Decoupling safety logic from model weights provides robust, interpretable, and adaptable solutions for AI governance.

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

### [306] [Strategy Executability in Mathematical Reasoning: Leveraging Human-Model Differences for Effective Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22583)
*Weida Liang,Yiyou Sun,Shuyuan Nan,Chuang Li,Dawn Song,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates instability in example-based guidance for mathematical reasoning, attributing it to gaps between strategy usage and executability. It introduces Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR) to improve accuracy by leveraging executability signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inconsistent effectiveness of example-based guidance in mathematical reasoning, despite its correctness and relevance, by exploring the gap between strategy usage and executability.

Method: The authors analyze paired human-written and model-generated solutions to identify differences in strategy usage and executability. They propose SSR, a framework that selectively retrieves and combines strategies based on empirical signals.

Result: SSR improves accuracy by up to +13 points on AIME25 and +5 points on Apex benchmarks, outperforming direct solving and other methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of executability-aware guidance and demonstrates SSR's effectiveness in enhancing mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

### [307] [Correcting Human Labels for Rater Effects in AI Evaluation: An Item Response Theory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22585)
*Jodi M. Casabianca,Maggie Beiting-Parrish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates integrating psychometric rater models into AI evaluations to address systematic errors in human judgments, improving reliability and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations are crucial in AI development but often suffer from systematic errors like rater severity and centrality, distorting conclusions.

Method: The paper uses psychometric rater models, specifically the multi-faceted Rasch model, to separate true output quality from rater biases. It applies this to the OpenAI summarization dataset.

Result: Adjusting for rater severity produced corrected estimates of summary quality and insights into rater performance, leading to more reliable evaluations.

Conclusion: Incorporating psychometric modeling enhances the transparency and reliability of human-in-the-loop AI evaluations, supporting better decision-making with adjusted scores.

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

*Sanjay Kariyappa,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SideQuest introduces a model-driven KV cache compression method for multi-hop reasoning tasks, reducing peak token usage by up to 65% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-running agentic tasks face memory inefficiency due to token-heavy external retrieval, degrading decode performance and requiring better KV cache compression.

Method: SideQuest uses the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to compress the KV cache by evaluating token usefulness, treating compression as an auxiliary task parallel to main reasoning.

Result: Evaluations show SideQuest cuts peak token usage by up to 65% in agentic tasks with negligible accuracy impact, surpassing heuristic methods.

Conclusion: SideQuest successfully addresses KV cache inefficiency in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering superior performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Route-planning agents powered by LLMs are promising but face evaluation challenges. MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark, is introduced to evaluate these agents in real-world mobility scenarios, revealing strengths and areas needing improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of systematic evaluation for LLM-based route-planning agents due to diverse demands and non-deterministic services.

Method: MobilityBench uses anonymized user queries and a deterministic API-replay sandbox for reproducible evaluation, assessing multiple dimensions like validity and efficiency.

Result: LLM-based agents perform well on basic tasks but struggle with personalized scenarios, highlighting gaps in preference-constrained planning.

Conclusion: The study provides a benchmark and toolkit for improving LLM-based route-planning agents, emphasizing the need for better personalized solutions.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AHBid, an adaptable hierarchical bidding framework for multi-channel online advertising, combining generative planning and real-time control to outperform baselines by 13.57%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of current auto-bidding methods (optimization-based and reinforcement learning) in dynamic, multi-channel advertising environments.

Method: AHBid integrates a diffusion model-based generative planner for budget allocation, a constraint enforcement mechanism, and a trajectory refinement mechanism for adaptability.

Result: Demonstrates a 13.57% improvement in return on investment compared to existing baselines via offline and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: AHBid effectively combines historical context and real-time data to enhance adaptability and performance in complex advertising scenarios.

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for LLM-powered agents that adapt to users and maintain continuity over time, enabling personalized interactions.

Method: Organizes literature around four components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution, synthesizing methods and analyzing user signal utilization.

Result: Highlights cross-component interactions, design trade-offs, tailored evaluation metrics, application scenarios, and future research directions.

Conclusion: Offers a framework for designing user-aligned, adaptive, and deployable personalized LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

### [312] [Knob: A Physics-Inspired Gating Interface for Interpretable and Controllable Neural Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22702)
*Siyu Jiang,Sanshuai Cui,Hui Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knob, a framework bridging deep learning and control theory to dynamically calibrate neural networks by modeling them as second-order mechanical systems, enabling intuitive human-adjustable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods are static and lack dynamic adaptability or intuitive human interfaces, missing opportunities for real-time adjustment.

Method: Knob maps neural gating to a second-order mechanical system, using damping ratio and natural frequency as tunable parameters. It employs logit-level convex fusion for adaptive temperature scaling and introduces Knob-ODE for dual-mode inference.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism, showing gate responses align with second-order control theory, enabling predictable tuning.

Conclusion: Knob offers a novel, dynamically tunable approach to neural network calibration with intuitive physical analogues, though it prioritizes concept validation over state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

TL;DR: RLHFless is a scalable serverless framework for synchronous RLHF training that improves efficiency, reduces costs, and minimizes idle time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and resource wastage in RLHF training due to dynamic demands and serverful infrastructures.

Method: Uses serverless computing, pre-computes shared prefixes, employs cost-aware actor scaling, and efficient workload assignment.

Result: Achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RLHFless effectively enhances RLHF training efficiency and cost-effectiveness in synchronous setups.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

TL;DR: Taesar is a data-centric framework that uses contrastive decoding to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences, outperforming model-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data sparsity, cold start, and domain gaps in recommendation models without relying on complex architectures.

Method: Contrastive decoding mechanism to encode cross-domain context into target sequences.

Result: Taesar outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models.

Conclusion: Taesar combines data- and model-centric strengths by generating enriched datasets, improving recommendation model performance.

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

*Qiannian Zhao,Chen Yang,Jinhao Jing,Yunke Zhang,Xuhui Ren,Lu Yu,Shijie Zhang,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGPO introduces a metacognitive entropy calibration framework to align intrinsic uncertainty with extrinsic rewards in LRMs, improving reasoning performance by selectively regulating overconfident failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR pipelines ignore model uncertainty, treating high- and low-uncertainty solutions equally. This mismatch hinders the shift from optimizing for correct answers to effective reasoning paths, especially in tasks like mathematics and question answering.

Method: EGPO estimates uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy and aligns it with correctness via asymmetric calibration. It preserves correct reasoning while regulating overconfident failures and recovers learning signals from degenerate rollouts.

Result: EGPO shows substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: EGPO provides a principled approach for advancing LRMs by integrating uncertainty-awareness into RLVR.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

### [316] [Decomposing Physician Disagreement in HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22758)
*Satya Borgohain,Roy Mariathas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study analyzes physician disagreement in medical AI evaluations, finding most variance unexplained by known factors, with disagreement peaking for borderline cases. Reducible uncertainty (e.g., missing context) increases disagreement, while irreducible uncertainty (genuine ambiguity) does not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify sources of disagreement among physicians evaluating medical AI outputs and determine actionable ways to improve evaluation design.

Method: Decomposed disagreement in the HealthBench dataset, testing factors like rubric identity, physician identity, metadata labels, normative language, medical specialty, surface-feature triage, and embeddings. Analyzed disagreement patterns and uncertainty categories.

Result: 81.8% of disagreement variance was unexplained. Disagreement peaked for borderline cases (AUC = 0.689). Reducible uncertainty doubled disagreement odds (OR = 2.55), while irreducible uncertainty had no effect (OR = 1.01).

Conclusion: Disagreement in medical AI evaluation is largely structural, but reducible uncertainty points to actionable design improvements (e.g., closing information gaps) where inherent ambiguity is not a factor.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

### [317] [AMA-Bench: Evaluating Long-Horizon Memory for Agentic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22769)
*Yujie Zhao,Boqin Yuan,Junbo Huang,Haocheng Yuan,Zhongming Yu,Haozhou Xu,Lanxiang Hu,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Zimeng Huang,Wentao Ni,Yuandong Tian,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMA-Bench to evaluate LLM agent memory beyond dialogue-focused benchmarks, addressing gaps in causality and retrieval methods, and proposes AMA-Agent for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agent memory are inadequate for real-world applications, focusing too narrowly on dialogue and lacking machine-generated representations.

Method: AMA-Bench includes real-world and synthetic agentic trajectories with QA pairs; AMA-Agent uses causality graphs and tool-augmented retrieval.

Result: AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% accuracy, outperforming baseline systems by 11.16%.

Conclusion: AMA-Bench and AMA-Agent effectively address limitations in current memory systems, enhancing LLM agent performance in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ClinDet-Bench evaluates LLMs' ability to handle incomplete clinical information, revealing their shortcomings in identifying determinable conditions and suggesting current benchmarks are inadequate for safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the critical need for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately determine when clinical information is sufficient or insufficient for decision-making, as premature judgments or unnecessary abstention can harm patient safety.

Method: The researchers developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that breaks down incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. This involves considering all hypotheses about missing information and verifying conclusions across them.

Result: Recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, exhibiting premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite performing well with complete information and explaining scoring knowledge correctly.

Conclusion: Existing benchmarks are insufficient for assessing LLM safety in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench offers a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, promoting appropriate abstention, with potential applications in medicine and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the plateauing capabilities of standalone LLMs and shortcomings of existing agent frameworks, such as naive workflows, unstable performance, and reliance on costly APIs.

Method: MiroFlow introduces an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode, and robust workflow execution to ensure stability and reproducibility.

Result: Extensive experiments show MiroFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and FutureX.

Conclusion: MiroFlow serves as an accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for deep research, advancing the field of LLM agent frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conceptual model and design principles for agentic AI to improve contextual judgment and proactive interventions by integrating observable situations, user-constructed meaning, and human behavior factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI lacks principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act proactively, often failing due to misinterpretations of user contexts.

Method: The authors develop a conceptual model dividing behavior into Scene, Context, and Human Behavior Factors, and derive five design principles for AI interventions.

Result: The model and principles offer a structured approach to designing AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for agentic AI systems that better align interventions with user needs and situational meanings.

Abstract: Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data yet often fails for lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.

TL;DR: FlexMS introduces a benchmark framework for evaluating deep learning models in mass spectrum prediction, offering insights into performance factors and practical guidance for model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of experimental spectra and heterogeneous methods necessitate standardized benchmarks for predicting molecular structure spectra using deep learning models.

Method: Developed FlexMS, a flexible framework for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction using preprocessed datasets and various metrics.

Result: Provided insights into performance factors like dataset diversity, hyperparameters, pretraining, and cross-domain transfer learning, along with practical retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlexMS offers practical guidance for model selection and addresses challenges in mass spectrum prediction, enhancing drug discovery and material science applications.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing presentation agents use rigid workflows and templates, limiting adaptability and refinement. DeepPresenter aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises slides using environment-grounded reflection, focusing on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides) for refinement.

Result: DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance and remains cost-effective with a fine-tuned 9B model.

Conclusion: DeepPresenter offers a flexible, feedback-driven approach to presentation generation, surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's role in creative math research beyond automation, focusing on collaboration.

Method: Case study using AI assistants for theorem formulation, proof exploration, and literature synthesis.

Result: AI excelled in algebra and systematics but required human verification and intuition.

Conclusion: AI accelerates math discovery with skepticism and oversight, not replacing human expertise.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

TL;DR: The paper introduces L-HAKT, a framework combining large language models and hyperbolic space to improve knowledge tracing by capturing hierarchical cognitive states and individualized problem difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge tracing methods lack depth in modeling cognitive state evolution and individualized difficulty perception due to limited semantic understanding.

Method: L-HAKT uses a teacher agent for semantic parsing and hierarchical dependency construction, a student agent for synthetic data generation, and contrastive learning in hyperbolic space to align real and synthetic data.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets confirm L-HAKT's effectiveness in enhancing knowledge tracing.

Conclusion: L-HAKT successfully addresses the limitations of current methods by leveraging semantic modeling and hyperbolic space for better hierarchical and individualized learning state representation.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs lack unified cognitive capabilities for general AI assistants, necessitating advancements in omni-modal perception and reasoning.

Method: OmniGAIA uses an omni-modal event graph for complex queries; OmniAtlas employs hindsight-guided tree exploration and OmniDPO for training.

Result: OmniAtlas improves tool-use capabilities in open-source models, enabling better performance in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: This work advances native omni-modal AI assistants, bridging gaps in multi-modal reasoning and tool integration.

Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

Abstract: In general reinforcement learning, all established optimal agents, including AIXI, are model-based, explicitly maintaining and using environment models. This paper introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), the first model-free agent proven to be asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal in general RL. AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.
